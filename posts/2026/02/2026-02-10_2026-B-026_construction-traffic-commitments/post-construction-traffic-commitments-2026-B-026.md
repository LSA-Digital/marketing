## Post
Construction traffic can turn "support" into "opposition" in a week.

Most permits already require some version of a traffic control plan. The failure mode is when it stays a PDF while the street changes every day.

Truck routes and delivery windows are common permit commitments, but they are often unenforceable in practice. When violations pile up, permits slow down.

We built Smart Mobility + LSARS workflows to make traffic commitments measurable: clear rules, visible violations, and a corrective-action loop.

**How it works:**
- **Rules**: define routes, delivery windows, and curb/loading constraints as structured rules everyone can see.
- **Monitoring**: log compliance and violations (with supporting evidence), not just anecdotal complaints.
- **Resolution**: publish corrective actions, SLAs, and closure so issues do not become permanent political scars.

**Result:** fewer complaint cycles and a cleaner, faster review path.

If you want to make traffic commitments enforceable (not aspirational), book a working session at https://lsars.com.
