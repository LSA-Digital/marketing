## Post
Construction traffic can turn "support" into "opposition" in a week.

Truck routes and delivery windows are common permit commitments, but they are often unenforceable in practice. When violations pile up, permits slow down.

We built Smart Mobility + LSARS workflows to make traffic commitments measurable: clear rules, visible violations, and a corrective-action loop.

**How it works:**
- **Rules**: define routes, delivery windows, and constraints that everyone can see.
- **Monitoring**: log compliance and violations (with supporting evidence), not just anecdotal complaints.
- **Resolution**: publish corrective actions, SLAs, and closure so issues do not become permanent political scars.

**Result:** fewer complaint cycles and a cleaner, faster review path.

If you want to make traffic commitments enforceable (not aspirational), book a working session at https://lsars.com.
