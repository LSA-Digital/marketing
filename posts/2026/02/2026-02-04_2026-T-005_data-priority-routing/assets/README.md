# Assets checklist (2026-T-005)

No assets have been created for this post yet.

If we want a concrete artifact for engineers, capture one of these:
- 1-page “routing rubric” (source tiers + when to escalate)
- Diagram: Tier 1 (authoritative) → Tier 2 (domain) → Tier 3 (research), with provenance annotations
- Redacted example: same question answered at two tiers, showing why tier choice matters
