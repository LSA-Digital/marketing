This comes from how we actually build - for example, we regularly switch between Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT Codex, and open-source agents like OpenCode to get different strengths and failure modes.

Most teams pick an agent stack the way they pick a CSS framework: one choice, forever.

That's not how this era works.

We push teams to get out of their comfort zone:

Use Cursor.

Use Claude.

Use ChatGPT Codex.

And try open-source tools like OpenCode (and emerging alternatives like Kimi code).

**Why agent/tool diversity matters:**
- **Different strengths:** some are better at architecture, some at refactors, some at UI, some at tests.
- **Different costs:** you can run cheap/fast models for CE (Continuous Exploration) and reserve premium for hard problems.
- **Different failure modes:** diversity catches blind spots.

The critical design choice: **your workflow should be portable.** The artifacts (plans, tests, evals, traces) are the stabilizer, not allegiance to a single tool.

That's Vibe Engineering: explore fast, but keep the output anchored to receipts that survive tool/model churn.
