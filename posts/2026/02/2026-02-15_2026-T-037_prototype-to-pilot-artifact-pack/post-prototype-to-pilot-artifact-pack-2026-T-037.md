This is based on real pilot work we've done - for example, the Human-in-the-Loop outreach system build shows why architecture, evidence, and governance artifacts matter before you scale.

The difference between a cool prototype and a pilot-ready system is rarely more code.

It's receipts.

When we push a concept toward a pilot, we ship an artifact pack that makes stakeholders comfortable saying yes.

**What's in the pack:**
- **Architecture diagram:** roles -> agents -> tools -> data -> governance.
- **Eval plan:** golden tasks, pass/fail thresholds, regression strategy.
- **Security boundaries:** identities, scopes, tool permissions, data handling.
- **Runbook:** what happens when it fails (and how we recover).
- **Demo script:** what we will show, what we will not claim.

The critical design choice: **pilot readiness is a product deliverable.** It isn't just "deploy and pray." It's a set of artifacts that prove we understand risk.

That is how Vibe Engineering stays fast without turning into fragile production.
