# Assets needed for 2026-B-002

## Missing assets (add before publish)

- [ ] CPS screenshot — probability of hitting date + driver breakdown
- [ ] “Real blockers” graphic (grid/water/noise/baseline health burden/transparency)
- [ ] LSARS branded header image (optional)

## Notes

- Keep visuals stakeholder-friendly (minimal jargon)
- If showing a score, show the *drivers* (bounds + drivers, not just a number)
