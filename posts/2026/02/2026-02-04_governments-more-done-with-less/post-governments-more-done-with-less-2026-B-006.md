## Post
Governments are being asked to review more permits, faster—without the headcount to match. The failure mode isn’t effort. It’s fragmentation: different documents, different versions of “the truth,” and no shared evidence trail.

What we did: we built an AI-enabled workflow that aligns the agency and the applicant around the same evidence—**without requiring the agency to buy or deploy new government software**.

This matters to the people in the middle:
- **Permitting agencies** get a clearer, auditable package they can review faster (and defend later).
- **Applicants** see what’s missing earlier, so they can fix issues before the clock (and public trust) runs out.
- **Communities** benefit when decisions are explained with evidence, not just asserted.

The principle is simple: if review capacity is the constraint, the system has to reduce rework—not add another portal nobody can adopt.

## Claim boundaries
- Stage: in progress
- What we can say safely:
  - We built an AI-enabled workflow designed to align agencies and applicants around shared evidence.
  - It is designed so agencies can participate without purchasing or deploying new government software.
- What we should NOT claim:
  - Guaranteed approval speedups, compliance outcomes, or quantified staffing reductions without measured proof.
