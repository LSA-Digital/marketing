## Post
Parking spillover is small on paper and massive in real life.

If neighborhoods experience months of disruption with no clear enforcement, the opposition hardens and the permit timeline stretches.

We built Smart Mobility + LSARS workflows that make parking rules enforceable and outcomes visible: policies, monitoring, and public resolution.

**How it works:**
- **Rules + enforcement**: define on-street and off-street parking rules that can actually be enforced.
- **Monitoring**: track utilization and violations so the conversation is grounded in facts.
- **Resolution**: publish complaints, corrective actions, and closure so issues do not linger.

**Result:** quality-of-life commitments become measurable, which reduces durable NIMBY coalitions.

If you want to reduce parking-driven opposition with evidence (not arguments), book a working session at https://lsars.com.
