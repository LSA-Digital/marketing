If the public cannot understand the KPI, it will not build trust.

Mobility commitments are often written in a way that only consultants can interpret. Communities and agencies need scorecards that translate operations into plain-language proof.

We built LSARS scorecards that publish mobility KPIs people actually care about (and can verify).

**How it works:**
- **KPI selection**: pick a short list that maps to lived experience (idling proxies, congestion hotspots, parking utilization, service reliability).
- **Operational data feeds**: connect Smart Mobility signals to the right geography and commitment.
- **Public scorecard + escalation**: show trends, thresholds, and a resolution path when performance drops.

**Result:** fewer debates about "what's true" and more focus on measurable delivery.

If you want a CBA scorecard that holds up in public, book a working session at https://lsars.com.
