If the public cannot understand the Key Performance Indicator (KPI), it will not build trust.

Mobility commitments are often written in a way that only consultants can interpret. Communities and agencies need scorecards that translate operations into plain-language proof.

There’s precedent: transportation agencies use systems that detect traffic queues and publish warning messages so safety isn’t an argument—it’s measurable.

We built LSARS scorecards that publish mobility KPIs people actually care about (and can verify).

**How it works:**
- **KPI selection**: pick a short list that maps to lived experience (congestion/travel time, queue risk, parking utilization/spillover, service reliability).
- **Operational data feeds**: connect traffic, parking, enforcement, and work-zone signals to the right geography and commitment.
- **Public scorecard + escalation**: show trends, thresholds, and a resolution path when performance drops.

**Result:** fewer debates about "what's true" and more focus on measurable delivery.
