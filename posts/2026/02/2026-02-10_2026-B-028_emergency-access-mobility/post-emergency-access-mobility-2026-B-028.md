## Post
"Cooling centers exist" is not the point.

In high-vulnerability tracts, the question is whether people can reliably reach them (or clinics) during heat events and emergencies.

Some transit agencies already offer fare-free rides to cooling centers during extreme heat.

Real-world examples: VTA and VIA have offered free rides to cooling centers during high temperatures, and Massachusetts publishes statewide cooling center guidance to help local agencies plan public access.

The missing piece in many permit commitments is making that access plan targeted, measurable, and reviewable.

We built LSARS + Smart Mobility workflows that connect vulnerability data to access plans, then publish proof that access actually improved.

**How it works:**
- **Vulnerability mapping**: identify heat and medical vulnerability hotspots using the Health and Social Risk Assessment engine (HSRA).
- **Access plan**: define shuttles, park-and-ride integration, mobility vouchers, and routing support.
- **Public reporting**: track access Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)... such as coverage, usage, reliability... and keep the audit trail.

**Result:** resilience becomes measurable, which makes commitments more credible and permits easier to defend.

If you want to pressure-test your access plan against real tract-level vulnerability, book a working session at https://lsars.com.
