"Cooling centers exist" is not the point.

In high-vulnerability tracts, the question is whether people can reliably reach them (or clinics) during heat events and emergencies.

We built LSARS + Smart Mobility workflows that connect vulnerability data to access plans, then publish proof that access actually improved.

**How it works:**
- **Vulnerability mapping**: identify heat and medical vulnerability hotspots using HSRA + SDOH context.
- **Access plan**: define shuttles, park-and-ride integration, mobility vouchers, and routing support.
- **Public reporting**: track access KPIs (coverage, usage, reliability) and keep the audit trail.

**Result:** resilience becomes measurable, which makes commitments more credible and permits easier to defend.

If you want to pressure-test your access plan against real tract-level vulnerability, book a working session at https://lsars.com.
