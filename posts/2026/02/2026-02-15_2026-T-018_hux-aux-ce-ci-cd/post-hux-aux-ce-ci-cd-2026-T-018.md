If your product has agents, you have two user experiences.

One for humans.

One for agents.

We use the terms on purpose:

- **Human-UX (HUX):** the experience for product managers, reviewers, and operators.
- **Agent-UX (AUX):** the experience for tool-using agents (APIs, schemas, errors, permissions, workflows).

The reason we talk about them together is simple: **bad Agent-UX (AUX) makes Human-UX (HUX) worse.**

When an agent can't reliably call tools (or gets ambiguous errors, partial permissions, non-idempotent endpoints), humans end up doing the worst kind of work: debugging invisible behavior.

This is why we connect HUX/AUX to the DevOps CE/CI/CD cycle:

- **CE (Continuous Exploration):** fast loops where 80/20 or 60/40 vibe/engineering makes sense.
- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment):** when the workflow touches real systems and the dial moves toward 40/60 or 20/80.

Note: **deployment is not delivery/release.** Product decides if/when deployed code is exposed to end users (and which ones).

**Result:** when AUX is deliberate, your CE loops get faster and your CI/CD loops get safer. You don't pay the "agent tax" later.
