# Assets checklist (2026-B-007)

No assets have been created for this post yet.

Good candidates for LinkedIn:
- Redacted screenshot/mock of the “report bundle” showing sections for assumptions, calculations, and citations
- One-slide visual: “Show your work” as a trust requirement (not a nice-to-have)
- Simple diagram: map context → report generation → reviewer verification loop
