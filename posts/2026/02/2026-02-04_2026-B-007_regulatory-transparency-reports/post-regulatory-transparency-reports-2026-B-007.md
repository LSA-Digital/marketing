## Post
“Aligned with the regulator” is not a statement you get to make. It’s something you have to *show*.

What we did: we built reporting so **for any map context**, reviewers can see the full chain—**calculations, assumptions, and citations**—not just a conclusion.

That matters because alignment isn’t one-size-fits-all:
- Some situations demand **strict agency alignment**.
- Others demand **more detailed health risk assessment** framing.
- Either way, trust comes from transparency that holds up under review.

The point isn’t to generate a prettier answer. The point is to generate a package a reviewer can validate without “trusting the black box.”

If you want to see what “show your work” looks like in a real permitting workflow, book a working session at `https://lsars.com`.

## Claim boundaries
- Stage: in progress
- What we can say safely:
  - We built report outputs that include calculations and citations for transparency and reviewability.
  - Reports are designed to be available for different contexts in the workflow (not a single static output).
- What we should NOT claim:
  - Guaranteed regulator acceptance, approval speedups, or quantified reductions in review time without measured proof.

## Notes (optional)
- Repost kit:
  - Business caption: Regulatory alignment isn’t a claim—it’s a trail reviewers can verify.
  - Technical caption: Provenance, calculations, and citations aren’t “extras”—they’re the product in high-stakes domains.
  - Partner voice caption: If you want trust, ship the evidence, not just the output.
