“Aligned with the regulator” is not a statement you get to make. It’s something you have to *show*.

For the LSARS Health & Social Risk Assessment (HSRA) + Permitting solution, we built reporting in context of **every locality in the U.S.** - so reviewers can see the full chain—**calculations, assumptions, and citations (**not just a possibly-hallucinated conclusion**).

That matters because alignment isn’t one-size-fits-all:

- Some situations demand **strict agency alignment**.
- Others demand **more detailed health risk assessment** framing.
- Either way, trust comes from transparency that holds up under review.

The point isn’t to generate an answer the user wants: it is to give the an answer they can trust.

If you want to see what “show your work” looks like in a real permitting workflow, book a working session at `https://lsars.com`.

## Claim boundaries

- Stage: in progress
- What we can say safely:
  - We built report outputs that include calculations and citations for transparency and reviewability.
  - Reports are designed to be available for different contexts in the workflow (not a single static output).
- What we should NOT claim:
  - Guaranteed regulator acceptance, approval speedups, or quantified reductions in review time without measured proof.

## Notes (optional)

- Repost kit:
  - Business caption: Regulatory alignment isn’t a claim—it’s a trail reviewers can verify.
  - Technical caption: Provenance, calculations, and citations aren’t “extras”—they’re the product in high-stakes domains.
  - Partner voice caption: If you want trust, ship the evidence, not just the output.

Good candidates for LinkedIn:
- Redacted screenshot/mock of the “report bundle” showing sections for assumptions, calculations, and citations
- One-slide visual: “Show your work” as a trust requirement (not a nice-to-have)
- Simple diagram: map context → report generation → reviewer verification loop
