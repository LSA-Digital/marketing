## Post

Data center permit fights are rarely about pollutants. They're about trust—grid costs, water scarcity, noise, accountability.

It's in everyone's interest to get permits approved faster. Permit requestors want predictable timelines. Communities want commitments they can verify. Regulators want reviews they can defend. The bottleneck isn't disagreement—it's evidence.

A useful AI answer in a high-stakes domain isn't the answer—it's the **evidence trail** behind it. When permits involve cancer risk calculations or community health impacts, stakeholders want to see the calculation, the source data, and the regulatory citation.

We built LSARS to make AI outputs auditable from the start.

**What this looks like in practice:**
- HSRA health risk calculations validated against CA OEHHA standards—matched to 5 significant figures across 797 pollutants
- Full reports with formulas and citations available for any map context
- A community portal showing promises vs actual spending and outcomes

Permit requestors can test scenarios faster—with defensible deltas vs baseline, not vibes. Regulators can review faster because they audit the same way they already work. Community leadership can see commitments tracked against real outcomes, backed by artifacts.

Auditability turns commitments into measurable proof points.
