Permit applicants promise community benefits. Communities hear vague assurances. The gap between "we'll help" and actual health outcomes is where trust breaks down.

We built the LSARS Permits and Health & Social Risk Assessment (HSRA) to close that gap — using pollutant/health condition data, combined with Social Determinants of Health data to target investments where they actually matter.

**How it works:**

- **HSRA baseline**: Quantify existing pollutant exposure, cancer risk, and cumulative health burden by census tract (not just facility-level emissions).
- **SDOH integration**: Layer in transportation access, food security, healthcare availability, and economic vulnerability to identify the real barriers to community health.
- **Targeted investments**: Instead of generic "community benefit" promises, permit holders commit to specific interventions—clinical care navigators, job training, transportation improvements—matched to the actual needs.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**

- **Communities** get investments that address real health determinants, not PR-friendly gestures
- **Permit applicants** make commitments they can actually deliver and measure
- **Regulators** see a clear link between permit conditions and community health outcomes

The result: permit negotiations grounded in evidence, not speculation—and commitments that can be tracked against actual outcomes.

### Needed assets
- [ ] Map visualization showing HSRA + SDOH overlay by census tract
- [ ] Example of targeted investment matching (SDOH gap → specific intervention)
- [ ] Before/after comparison of generic vs. data-driven community benefits

### Notes
- Consider showing a specific community example (anonymized if needed)
- Could visualize the HSRA baseline → SDOH layer → investment recommendation flow
