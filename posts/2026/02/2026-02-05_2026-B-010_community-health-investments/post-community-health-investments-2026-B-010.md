Permit applicants promise community benefits. Communities hear vague assurances. The gap between "we'll help" and actual health outcomes is where trust breaks down.

We built the LSARS Permits and Health Risk Assessment (HRA) to close that gap — using pollutant/health condition data, combined with Social Determinants of Health data to target investments where they actually matter.

**How it works:**

- **HRA baseline**: Quantify existing pollutant exposure, cancer risk, and cumulative health burden by census tract (not just facility-level emissions).
- **SDOH integration**: Layer in transportation access, food security, healthcare availability, and economic vulnerability to identify the real barriers to community health.
- **Targeted investments**: Instead of generic "community benefit" promises, permit holders commit to specific interventions—clinical care navigators, job training, transportation improvements—matched to the actual needs.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**

- **Communities** get investments that address real health determinants, not PR-friendly gestures
- **Permit applicants** make commitments they can actually deliver and measure
- **Regulators** see a clear link between permit conditions and community health outcomes

The result: permit negotiations grounded in evidence, not speculation—and commitments that can be tracked against actual outcomes.
