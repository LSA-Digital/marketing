The fastest way to lose a month on a utility project is to say "minor alignment change" and then rediscover (the hard way) which permits and exhibits that change just invalidated.

Concrete example (from a public docket): the Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project (EFSB 24-01 / D.P.U. 24-135) proposes an approximately 3.2-mile underground 115 kV transmission line across Weymouth and Hingham, connecting a new tap station in Weymouth to a new substation in Hingham.

The filings describe multiple route options (a Preferred "Broad Street Route" and a Noticed Alternative "Lake Street Route"). In projects like this, changing the route or construction method is not a single edit: it cascades into traffic control planning, wetlands-related conditions (including Orders of Conditions), and re-packaging evidence so reviewers can confirm the new version is consistent.

We built LSARS to help utility teams keep permitting moving when plans change by treating change as a first-class, auditable event.

**How it works:**
- **Versioned evidence**: lock each submittal to the exact drawings, GIS layers, and assumptions it was based on.
- **Impact-aware deltas**: when an input changes, show what changed and which permits/sections/exhibits are affected.
- **Reviewer-ready re-packaging**: regenerate the affected summaries with citations back to updated sources so reviewers can verify quickly.

**Result:** fewer restarts, fewer "please resubmit" cycles, and changes that are explainable instead of suspicious.

If you want to pressure-test your permit stack and your change-control plan, book a working session at https://lsars.com.
