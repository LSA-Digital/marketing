The fastest way to lose a month on a utility project is to say "minor alignment change" and then rediscover (the hard way) which permits and exhibits that change just invalidated.

Concrete example: a substation upgrade plus a ~3-mile 115kV line extension to serve a new 50-60MW load. Someone shifts the alignment to avoid one parcel. Now your crossing exhibits change, your environmental footprint may change, and multiple agencies are suddenly reviewing different versions of the truth.

We built LSARS to keep utility permitting moving when plans change by treating change as a first-class, auditable event.

**How it works:**
- **Versioned evidence**: lock each submittal to the exact drawings, GIS layers, and assumptions it was based on.
- **Impact-aware deltas**: when an input changes, show what changed and which permits/sections/exhibits are affected.
- **Reviewer-ready re-packaging**: regenerate the affected summaries with citations back to updated sources so reviewers can verify quickly.

**Result:** fewer restarts, fewer "please resubmit" cycles, and changes that are explainable instead of suspicious.

If you want to pressure-test your permit stack and your change-control plan, book a working session at https://lsars.com.
