## Post

We've built and operated compliance-heavy systems - and we don't treat compliance as a quarterly scramble.

We practice automated compliance: for example, we use Drata.com to monitor controls continuously and keep evidence current.

This matters for Vibe Engineering because speed doesn't survive audit surprises.

**What automated compliance looks like in practice:**
- **Controls are owned:** every control has an accountable owner and a clear "how it's satisfied" story.
- **Evidence is continuous:** evidence isn't a PDF hunt; it's collected and refreshed as the system changes.
- **Drift is visible:** when something slips (access, tooling, policy, configuration), you see it early.
- **Engineering stays in the loop:** compliance becomes part of the DevOps CE/CI/CD cycle, not a separate lane.

The critical design choice: **"secure and compliant" has to be operational, not aspirational.**
