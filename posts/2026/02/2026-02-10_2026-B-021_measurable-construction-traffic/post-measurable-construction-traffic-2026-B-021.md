# "Construction traffic" shouldn't be a mystery

"Construction traffic" is a top NIMBY weapon because it's usually unmanaged chaos. Promises to "be careful" are ignored.

We track truck routes and delivery windows in the Permit Intelligence Portal to make traffic commitments measurable.

**How it works:**
- **Route Fencing**: GPS enforcement ensures trucks stick to approved arterials.
- **Window Management**: Scheduling system blocks deliveries during school drop-off or commute hours.
- **Public Violation Log**: Transparent reporting of infractions and corrective actions.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Government** Enforces constraints without expensive road patrols.
- **Community** Sees valid complaints addressed instantly.
- **Permit Requestor** Eliminates "traffic chaos" as a valid objection.

**Result:** Construction logistics become a transparent operation, not a neighborhood menace.
