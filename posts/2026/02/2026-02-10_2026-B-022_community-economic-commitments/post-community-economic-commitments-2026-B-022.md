Community economic commitments do not fail because people do not care.

They fail because the commitment is vague, the delivery is invisible, and nobody can tell the difference between "announced" and "done."

We built LSARS to turn economic development promises into an execution system: clear programs, owners, milestones, and proof.

**How it works:**
- **Commitment plan**: structure cash commitments into specific programs (job training, transportation support, clinical navigation resources).
- **Milestones + owners**: define what ships, when, and who is accountable (not just a PDF paragraph).
- **Proof + reporting**: publish spend and delivery progress so community leadership can verify outcomes over time.

**Result:** economic benefit becomes auditable, which reduces opposition and makes permits easier to defend.

If you want to design commitments that communities can verify, book a working session at https://lsars.com.
