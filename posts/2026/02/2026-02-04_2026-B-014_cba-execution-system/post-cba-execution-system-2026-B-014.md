Community Benefit Agreements can fail quietly — especially when commitments aren’t written and run with clear metrics, monitoring, and enforcement.

Not because the intent was bad, but because the commitments don't get consistent, automated transparency and accountability.

We built a Permit Intelligence workflow that turns CBA commitments into **trackable work** with milestones, SLAs, and visible dashboards.

**How it works:**
- **Structured intake**: commitments are captured as measurable items (not paragraphs in a PDF).
- **Versioned milestones**: changes are tracked, owners are clear, and deadlines aren’t “interpretive.”
- **Issue routing + resolution**: complaints and exceptions become auditable tickets with published outcomes.

**Result:** commitments stop being PR and start being something communities and reviewers can verify.

If you’re serious about accountability, you need a system that makes follow-through visible. We’ll show you the workflow in a working session: https://lsars.com

## Evidence / citations
“Community Benefit Agreements can fail quietly — especially when commitments aren’t written and run with clear metrics, monitoring, and enforcement.”

There’s solid basis for the mechanism behind “fail quietly” (weak/no enforcement + weak monitoring/reporting = commitments can slip without clear visibility), but the exact phrasing “often fail” reads like an outcome/frequency claim that’s harder to prove.
Most defensible support I found:
- World Resources Institute (2025) analyzed 72 publicly available “community benefits frameworks” (including CBAs) and found: “79% of frameworks include language on reporting and monitoring mechanisms. *Only 48% include text on enforcement mechanisms.*”

- Same WRI piece on implementation opacity: “agreements typically provide little to no practical details on how to monitor, measure or report progress… and often lack a clear roadmap specifying what exact metrics should be reported and monitored, how frequently, and by what methods. As a result, communities struggle to independently track a plan’s implementation and hold developers accountable…”
- Same WRI piece on why it can “go quiet”: “Without adequate enforcement, community benefits frameworks can be undermined, and developers may fail to meet their obligations once the initial political or public pressure fades.”
