## Post
Community Benefit Agreements (CBAs) often fail quietly.

Not because the intent was bad, but because the commitments don't get consistent, automated transparency and accountability.

We built a Permit Intelligence workflow that turns CBA commitments into **trackable work** with milestones, SLAs, and visible dashboards.

**How it works:**
- **Structured intake**: commitments are captured as measurable items (not paragraphs in a PDF).
- **Versioned milestones**: changes are tracked, owners are clear, and deadlines aren’t “interpretive.”
- **Issue routing + resolution**: complaints and exceptions become auditable tickets with published outcomes.

**Result:** commitments stop being PR and start being something communities and reviewers can verify.

If you’re serious about accountability, you need a system that makes follow-through visible. We’ll show you the workflow in a working session: https://lsars.com
