The most expensive words in permitting are: "It should be approved by ___."

It's in everyone's interest to get permits approved faster—but timelines don't fail all at once. They fail when hidden blockers stay hidden: grid upgrades, water constraints, noise, baseline health burden, and the trust gap created when progress can't be explained.

We built a **Community Permitability Score (CPS)** that treats the "approval date" like what it really is: a **probability**, with real drivers.

Key supporting details:
- CPS factors in the **real blockers** that actually move dates (not wishful schedules).
- It provides a **probability of hitting a specific date**, so planning can be based on risk—not hope.
- It reduces timeline risk by helping teams **target investments** and publish **accountable milestones** that stakeholders can track.

Result: more credible investment planning, fewer surprises, and fewer "trust collapses" that turn a permit into a fight.

### Missing assets (add before publish)

- [ ] CPS screenshot — probability of hitting date + driver breakdown
- [ ] “Real blockers” graphic (grid/water/noise/baseline health burden/transparency)
- [ ] LSARS branded header image (optional)

### Notes

- Keep visuals stakeholder-friendly (minimal jargon)
- If showing a score, show the *drivers* (bounds + drivers, not just a number)
