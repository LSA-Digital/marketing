## Post

The most expensive words in permitting are: “It should be approved by ___.”

It’s in everyone’s interest to get permits approved faster—but timelines don’t fail all at once. They fail when hidden blockers stay hidden: grid upgrades, water constraints, noise, baseline health burden, and the trust gap created when progress can’t be explained.

We built a **Community Permitability Score (CPS)** that treats the “approval date” like what it really is: a **probability**, with real drivers.

Key supporting details:
- CPS factors in the **real blockers** that actually move dates (not wishful schedules).
- It provides a **probability of hitting a specific date**, so planning can be based on risk—not hope.
- It reduces timeline risk by helping teams **target investments** and publish **accountable milestones** that stakeholders can track.

Result: more credible investment planning, fewer surprises, and fewer “trust collapses” that turn a permit into a fight.

## Claim boundaries
- Stage: in progress
- What we can say safely:
  - CPS provides a probability of hitting a specific permit approval date based on real blockers (grid upgrades, water, noise, baseline health burden, transparency)
  - The purpose is more credible timelines and investment planning, and to reduce surprises
- What we should NOT claim:
  - Guaranteed approval dates
  - Specific time/cost savings without measured evidence
  - Agency endorsement

## Notes (optional)
- Repost kit:
  - Business caption: "A permit approval date isn’t a date—it’s a probability. CPS makes the drivers visible so everyone can plan with less surprise."
  - Technical caption: "We treat permit timelines as uncertainty problems: explicit drivers, bounded estimates, and auditable artifacts."
  - Partner voice caption: "Transparency beats optimism. CPS turns 'should be approved by' into evidence-backed planning."
- Question prompt: "What tends to break permit timelines in your world—missing evidence, hidden infrastructure constraints, or stakeholder trust?"
