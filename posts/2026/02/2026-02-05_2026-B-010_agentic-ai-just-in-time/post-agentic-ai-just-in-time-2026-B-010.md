## Post

When a permit applicant asks about NIMBY opposition, they don't need a generic chatbot answer. They need expertise from someone who understands community relations, political dynamics, and enforceable commitments.

We built a system where specialized Permit Intelligence agents are called by a lead agent only when their domain expertise is needed—public relations for NIMBY issues, health risk for HRA questions, regulatory for compliance concerns.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**

- **Permit applicants** get answers grounded in the right expertise, not a single model trying to know everything
- **Regulators** see responses that respect the boundaries between health science, legal compliance, and community engagement
- **Communities** benefit from answers that draw on SDOH data, health burden analysis, and accountability frameworks—not vague reassurances

Each agent operates with isolated data permissions. The PR agent can't access raw health calculations. The HRA agent can't see community negotiation history. This isn't just security—it's integrity.

The result: faster, more credible responses that don't require users to figure out which expert to ask.
