# Your Work Zone Plan Isn't Real Until It's a Feed

Most construction traffic commitments fail the same way: the plan is a PDF, but the street changes every day.

Permits can require truck routes, delivery windows, lane closures, and detours. Without a live, auditable signal, everyone ends up arguing about anecdotes.

We built LSARS + Smart Mobility workflows to turn work zone plans into a publishable feed with compliance proof: rules, events, exceptions, and resolution.

**How it works:**
- **Define commitments as rules**: routes, curb/loading constraints, and time windows in a structured, versioned format.
- **Publish authoritative changes**: planned closures, lane shifts, and detours as a reusable work-zone feed (not email chains).
- **Close the loop**: log violations and corrective actions so issues reach closure, not permanence.

**Why this matters:**
- **Communities** get predictable access and a visible path to resolution when conditions break.
- **Permit requestors** reduce opposition risk by proving follow-through, not repeating promises.
- **Reviewers** get evidence they can validate without expanding headcount.

**Result:** fewer complaint cycles, cleaner compliance conversations, and faster permitting under scrutiny.

If you want work zone commitments that hold up in public, book a working session at https://lsars.com.
