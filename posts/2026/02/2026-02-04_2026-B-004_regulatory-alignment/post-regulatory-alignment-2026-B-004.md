When stakeholders ask "Is this calculation right?", the answer depends on which regulatory framework they're operating under.

EPA and California OEHHA don't calculate health risks the same way. Age sensitivity, diesel particulate handling, exposure assumptions—the details differ, and those differences matter when permits are on the line.

LSARS supports both EPA and CA OEHHA modes, so users can choose the framework that fits their regulatory context—strict federal alignment or California's more detailed Health Risk Assessment methodology.

Why does this matter?

- **For permit requestors**: You get calculations that match what regulators expect, reducing back-and-forth and rework.

- **For regulatory agencies**: You see outputs in the format and methodology you're trained to review, with full calculation transparency.

- **For communities**: The numbers aren't a black box—they're grounded in the same standards your regulators use.

This isn't about being flexible for flexibility's sake. It's about producing results that can be verified against the exact same methodology regulators apply. That's how you build trust that survives scrutiny.
