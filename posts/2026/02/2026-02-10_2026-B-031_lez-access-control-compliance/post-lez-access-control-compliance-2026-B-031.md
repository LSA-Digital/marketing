Rules on paper are not compliance. Compliance is data.

Low Emission Zone (LEZ) policies and access-control commitments are often written into permits, but without measurement they turn into endless debates.

Many real-world LEZ programs already rely on automated enforcement and publish compliance data. The permitting opportunity is to treat that same data exhaust as a proof trail: defined rules, measured exceptions, and corrective action.

Real-world example: London's ULEZ publishes compliance data and evaluation reporting. That's the bar for turning LEZ commitments into something stakeholders can verify.

We built LSARS scorecards that connect access control and LEZ compliance signals to a public, auditable proof trail.

**How it works:**
- **Define the rule**: vehicle types, hours, exemptions, and the exact compliance criteria.
- **Measure**: connect access-control events and mobility signals to those criteria.
- **Publish proof**: show compliance KPIs, exceptions, and corrective actions so facts do not get re-litigated.

**Result:** commitments become enforceable and reviewable, which reduces timeline risk.

If you want LEZ commitments that hold up under scrutiny, book a working session at https://lsars.com.
