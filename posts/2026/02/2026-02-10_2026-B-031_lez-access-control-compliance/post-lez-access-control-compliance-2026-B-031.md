## Post
Rules on paper are not compliance. Compliance is data.

Low Emission Zone (LEZ) policies and access-control commitments are often written into permits, but without measurement they turn into endless debates.

We built LSARS scorecards that connect access control and LEZ compliance signals to a public, auditable proof trail.

**How it works:**
- **Define the rule**: vehicle types, hours, exemptions, and the exact compliance criteria.
- **Measure**: connect access-control events and mobility signals to those criteria.
- **Publish proof**: show compliance KPIs, exceptions, and corrective actions so facts do not get re-litigated.

**Result:** commitments become enforceable and reviewable, which reduces timeline risk.

If you want LEZ commitments that hold up under scrutiny, book a working session at https://lsars.com.
