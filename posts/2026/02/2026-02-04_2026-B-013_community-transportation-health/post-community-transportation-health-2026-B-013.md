## Post
When transportation is unreliable, “access to care” becomes a slogan—not a reality.

We built a way to use health-risk + SDOH context to identify where transportation is a binding constraint, then recommend practical mobility investments communities can evaluate.

**How it works:**
- **Measure access gaps**: combine community health context with transportation barriers.
- **Generate options**: routes, vouchers, shuttles, smart mobility—matched to the places where access is actually failing.
- **Make it reviewable**: show the rationale, the affected areas, and what outcomes to track.

**Why this matters:**
- **Communities** get interventions tied to real constraints, not generic programs.
- **Permit requestors** can align mobility commitments to measurable community benefit.
- **Reviewers** get evidence they can validate (inputs, assumptions, and expected impact).

If you want transportation commitments that are defensible—and measurable—we’ll walk through a working example with you. https://lsars.com
