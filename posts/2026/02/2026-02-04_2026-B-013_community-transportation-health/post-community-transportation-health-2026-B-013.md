When transportation is unreliable, “access to care” becomes a slogan—not a reality.

LSA Digital's Health & Social Risk Assessment AI solution identifies where transportation is a binding constraint, allowing the LSARS Permit Intelligence portal to recommend practical community mobility investments.

**How it works:**
- **Measure access gaps**: combine community health context with transportation barriers.
- **Generate options**: routes, vouchers, shuttles, smart mobility—matched to the places where access is actually failing.
- **Make it reviewable**: show the rationale, the affected areas, and what outcomes to track.

**Why this matters:**
- **Communities** get interventions tied to real constraints, not generic programs.
- **Permit requestors** can align mobility commitments to measurable community benefit.
- **Reviewers** get evidence they can validate (inputs, assumptions, and expected impact).

If you want transportation commitments that are defensible and measurable, we’ll walk through a working example with you. https://lsars.com
