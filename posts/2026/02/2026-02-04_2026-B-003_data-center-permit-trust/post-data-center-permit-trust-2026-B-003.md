Data center permit fights are rarely about pollutants—they're about trust.

Communities don't oppose projects because of marginal air quality impacts. They oppose them because of grid cost fears, water scarcity concerns, the constant hum of cooling systems, and a history of broken promises.

LSARS addresses these real blockers head-on by making commitments measurable and enforceable—not just words in a press release.

Here's how:

- **Energy burden analysis**: We use SDOH data to identify neighborhoods most vulnerable to utility rate increases, then design targeted investments (weatherization, bill credits, efficiency upgrades) that address ratepayer fears with evidence.

- **Water transparency**: Instead of verbal assurances, we publish dashboards showing caps, potable vs. reclaimed usage, drought-trigger operating rules, and compliance history—so communities can verify, not just trust.

- **Noise accountability**: "The hum will never stop" becomes measurable: setbacks, acoustic design standards, decibel limits, continuous monitoring, and public scorecards tracked in the Permit Intelligence Portal.

The result: permit timelines that don't stall on NIMBY opposition, because commitments are credible from day one.

It's in everyone's interest to get permits approved faster—permit requestors get certainty, communities get enforceable benefits, and agencies get fewer re-litigated facts. LSARS makes that possible by turning trust into a system, not a handshake.

## Claim boundaries
- Stage: in progress
- What we can say safely:
  - LSARS uses HRA + SDOH data to design community commitments
  - The Permit Intelligence Portal tracks and publishes compliance
  - The approach addresses NIMBY concerns (grid, water, noise, accountability)
  - Multi-stakeholder framing: faster permits benefit everyone
- What we should NOT claim:
  - Specific permit approval timelines or guarantees
  - Quantified cost savings without cited evidence
  - That any specific data center project used this approach (unless approved)
