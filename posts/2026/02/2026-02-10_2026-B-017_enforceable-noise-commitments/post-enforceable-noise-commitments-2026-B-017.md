### Make the "hum" measurable and managed

The "hum" noise pollution is a major data center complaint for local communities. PDF acoustic reports won't fix it.

We built continuous noise monitoring into the Permit Intelligence Portal to make decibel limits enforceable and transparent.

**How it works:**
- **Continuous Monitoring**: IoT integration for real-time decibel tracking at property lines.
- **Setback Logic**: Automated validation of acoustic design against community zoning.
- **Public Scorecards**: Red/Green status visible to residents.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Community** Validated peace of mind, not just promises.
- **Permit Requestor** Proves compliance to avoid costly injunctions.
- **Government** Reduces noise complaint triage time.

**Result:** Noise becomes a managed metric, not a project-killing complaint.

Real-world example: Fairfax County approved a data center zoning ordinance amendment that requires pre- and post-construction noise studies for compliance with the Noise Ordinance, along with stronger equipment enclosure/screening to reduce noise impacts.
