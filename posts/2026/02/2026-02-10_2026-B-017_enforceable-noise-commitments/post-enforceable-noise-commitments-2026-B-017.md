# How does LSARS make noise commitments enforceable (decibel limits + continuous monitoring)?

- **ID**: 2026-B-017
- **Date**: 2026-02-10
- **Status**: draft
- **Type**: Business
- **Product**: LSARS
- **Artifacts**: Convert 'the hum will never stop' into measurable commitments: setbacks, acoustic design, decibel limits, continuous monitoring, and public scorecards tracked in the Permit Intelligence Portal.

# Make the "hum" measurable and managed

The "hum" is the #1 community fear for data centers. PDF acoustic reports don't fix it—enforceable data does.

We built continuous noise monitoring into the Permit Intelligence Portal to make decibel limits enforceable and transparent.

**How it works:**
- **Continuous Monitoring**: IoT integration for real-time decibel tracking at property lines.
- **Setback Logic**: Automated validation of acoustic design against community zoning.
- **Public Scorecards**: Red/Green status visible to residents.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Community** Validated peace of mind, not just promises.
- **Permit Requestor** Proves compliance to avoid costly injunctions.
- **Government** Reduces noise complaint triage time.

**Result:** Noise becomes a managed metric, not a project-killing emotional argument.
