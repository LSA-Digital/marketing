## Post
The bottleneck in product management isn't the quality of your research—it's the friction of data transfer. Product managers spend hours in ChatGPT or Claude refining strategy, analyzing competitors, and drafting requirements. But when the chat ends, those insights often stay trapped in the browser tab. The product system remains stale while the real work happens in a silo.

We built an EPMS widget that lives directly inside ChatGPT and Claude to bridge this gap. It allows research to flow both ways without copy-pasting or manual updates.

**How it works:**
- **Download product data**: Pull live EPMS data directly into your chat context so the AI has the ground truth of your current roadmap and constraints.
- **Real-time sync**: As you make decisions or refine requirements in the chat, push those updates back to EPMS instantly. No copy-paste.
- **Progressive disclosure**: The widget stays out of the way until you need it — collapsed metric chips expand to full detail on click.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Product managers**: Your system of record stays current with the latest strategic thinking. No more stale roadmap documents.
- **Decision speed**: Move from research to execution in a single session by eliminating the manual overhead of updating systems.
- **AI output quality**: Feed the LLM actual product data instead of vague descriptions. Grounded context produces grounded advice.

**Result:**
Working prototype with 102 integration tests passing. The strategic work happening in AI interfaces is immediately captured and actionable in the product system.
