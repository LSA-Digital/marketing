## Post
Mobility commitments fail when they are generic.

"We'll improve transportation" does not help if the real barrier is no-vehicle households, disability access, language isolation, or heat vulnerability.

Public health planners already treat “lack of access to transportation” as a core vulnerability factor. Permits move faster when your mobility commitments are anchored in that reality.

We built a 3-part solution that delivers targeted, measurable mobility investments. 
- AI Health & Social Risk Assessment
- LSARS Permit Intelligence
- Smart Mobility solutions 

**How it works:**
- **Barrier map**: identify the highest-friction tracts (no vehicle, elderly/disabled concentration, language isolation).
- **Investment options**: recommend practical interventions (shuttles, vouchers, multilingual wayfinding, access-to-services improvements).
- **Accountability**: publish simple KPIs so the community can see delivery, not just intent.

**Result:** investments are defensible (rooted in need) and trust-building (measured over time).

If you want to turn SDOH into commitments that actually land, book a working session at https://lsars.com.
