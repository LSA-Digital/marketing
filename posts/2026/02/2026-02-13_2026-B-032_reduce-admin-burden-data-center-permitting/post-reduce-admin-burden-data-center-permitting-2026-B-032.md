## Post
Data center permits rarely stall because nobody did the work. They stall because the work can't be reviewed.

Evidence lives in too many places: PDFs, email threads, spreadsheets, and "latest_v7_FINAL" attachments. Every handoff creates rework.

Real-world example: PW Digital Gateway hearings in Prince William County, Virginia surfaced the review bottleneck - late amended filings, confusion over "new vs. old" application materials, and staff needing time to independently verify thousands of changes before commenting.

We built LSARS Permit Intelligence to turn permitting into a single, auditable workflow: shared dashboards (including a community dashboard), reviewer-ready evidence packages, and bounded agentic AI workflow that keeps the citation trail intact.

**How it works:**
- **Structured intake**: ingest core documents, extract key parameters, and preserve citations back to source.
- **Workflow + dashboards**: turn requirements into owners, decision gates, and reviewer-ready checklists, with a community dashboard for commitments.
- **Agentic AI + change control**: when inputs change, we show the delta and regenerate only what changed, without losing citations or the audit trail.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Permit Requestor** Reduces back-and-forth and avoids expensive late-stage surprises.
- **Agencies** Get consistent evidence, clear deltas, and fewer "which version is true?" loops.
- **Communities** See commitments tracked with proof, not buried in documents.

**Result:** less churn, fewer surprises, and a faster path to a defensible permit.
