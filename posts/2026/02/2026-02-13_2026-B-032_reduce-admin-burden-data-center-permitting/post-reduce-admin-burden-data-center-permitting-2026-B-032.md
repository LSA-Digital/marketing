## Post
Data center permits rarely stall because nobody did the work. They stall because the work can't be reviewed.

Evidence lives in too many places: PDFs, email threads, spreadsheets, and "latest_v7_FINAL" attachments. Every handoff creates rework.

We built LSARS Permit Intelligence to turn permitting into a single, auditable workflow: shared dashboards, reviewer-ready evidence packages, and bounded AI assistance that keeps the citation trail intact.

**How it works:**
- **Structured intake**: ingest core documents, extract key parameters, and preserve citations back to source.
- **Shared workflow dashboard**: turn requirements into owners, decision gates, and reviewer-ready checklists.
- **Change control + packaging**: when inputs change, we show the delta and regenerate only what changed, without losing the audit trail.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Permit Requestor** Reduces back-and-forth and avoids expensive late-stage surprises.
- **Agencies** Get consistent evidence, clear deltas, and fewer "which version is true?" loops.
- **Communities** See commitments tracked with proof, not buried in documents.

**Result:** less churn, fewer surprises, and a faster path to a defensible permit.
