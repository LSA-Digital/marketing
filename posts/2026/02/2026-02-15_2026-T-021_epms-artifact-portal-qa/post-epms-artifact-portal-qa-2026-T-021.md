Every product team says they want alignment.

Then the truth gets scattered across:

Decks. Docs. Spreadsheets. Loom videos. Slack threads.

So meetings turn into archaeology.

We built EPMS as an investor/product management portal that stores artifacts (markdown documents, live spreadsheets, videos, infographics, slide decks) and makes them queryable in real time.

**What the EPMS chatbot should be able to answer (from the artifacts):**
- **Ideas:** what are we considering right now?
- **KPIs:** what value proposition metrics actually matter?
- **Priorities:** which features move those KPIs?
- **Messaging:** what story are we telling and why?
- **Financial impact:** what's the expected financial impact, and is it feasible?

This is how Vibe Engineering stays fast without becoming chaotic: we explore quickly, but we keep the exploration anchored to artifacts that survive the next meeting.
