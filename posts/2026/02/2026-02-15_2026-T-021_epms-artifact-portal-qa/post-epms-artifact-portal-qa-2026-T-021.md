If your product truth is buried in static PDFs and scattered Slack threads, your team isn't building; they're doing archaeology. Every meeting becomes a search for the "latest" version of a deck or a spreadsheet, and alignment is just a polite word for shared confusion. We built EPMS to solve this by turning product truth into a living system of queryable artifacts.

This is Vibe Engineering—vibe coding for exploration + production-grade engineering for shipping—applied to product management. In EPMS, we store everything from markdown docs to live spreadsheets and video walkthroughs as first-class entities. We've modeled 33 database entities with 22 relationship types to ensure that every artifact is connected to the broader product strategy. Our guest portal features an AI chat that allows investors and partners to query these artifacts in real time, getting answers that are anchored in evidence, not just vibes.

We even implemented an "Interview mode" with formatted output and lettered options (A/B/C/D) to help stakeholders navigate complex decisions with checklist tracking. This ensures that Continuous Exploration (CE) doesn't just produce noise; it produces structured, actionable intelligence. When your product truth is a living system, you stop wasting time digging through the past and start focusing on the features that actually move your KPIs. By anchoring our exploration in a production-grade artifact portal, we ensure that every idea is backed by the receipts of actual engineering.
