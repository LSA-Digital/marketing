## Post
“When will the permit be approved?” is the wrong question.

The question is: **what’s the probability of hitting a date—and what’s driving the spread?**

We built a way to turn a hand-wavy timeline into a bounded forecast that teams can actually plan around.

**How it works:**
- **Probability, not a point estimate**: forecast the likelihood of approval by date (not a single “ETA”).
- **Drivers, not vibes**: surface the biggest uncertainty contributors (administrative burden, community concerns, data gaps).
- **Scenario-ready**: test mitigation and investment options against timeline risk *before* you commit money and messaging.

**Why this matters:**
- **Investors and operators** can plan capital and staffing with realistic confidence.
- **Permit teams** stop thrashing and start targeting the drivers that move the date.
- **Communities and reviewers** get clarity on what’s being done to reduce risk and improve outcomes.

If your timeline is a guess, the rest of your plan is too. We’ll walk through a bounded-timeline workflow in a working session: https://lsars.com
