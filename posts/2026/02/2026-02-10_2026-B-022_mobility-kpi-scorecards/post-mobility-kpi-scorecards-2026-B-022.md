- **Status**: draft
- **Type**: Business

- **Product**: LSARS, Smart Mobility
- **Artifacts**: Combine LSARS accountability with Smart Mobility operations to publish KPIs the public understands (idling proxies, congestion hotspots, parking utilization, service reliability) as enforceable Community Benefit Agreement scorecards.

# Complex traffic studies hide reality—KPIs reveal it

300-page traffic studies are where transparency goes to die. Communities trust what they can understand.

We publish understandable mobility KPIs as enforceable CBA scorecards.

**How it works:**
- **Idling Proxies**: Measures congestion impact without privacy-invasive tracking.
- **Parking Utilization**: Real-time occupancy metrics for agreed-upon lots.
- **Service Reliability**: Tracking shuttle and transit on-time performance against promises.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Community** Understands the data without a traffic engineering degree.
- **Permit Requestor** Demonstrates operational excellence transparently.
- **Government** Has a simple dashboard for CBA compliance.

**Result:** Traffic impact becomes a shared fact, not a debate.
