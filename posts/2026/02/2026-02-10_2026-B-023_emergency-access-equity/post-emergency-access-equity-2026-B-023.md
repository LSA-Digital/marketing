# How does LSARS + Smart Mobility improve emergency access (cooling centers/clinics)?

- **ID**: 2026-B-023
- **Date**: 2026-02-10
- **Status**: draft
- **Type**: Business
- **Expert**: Dr. Thad Perry
- **Product**: LSARS, Smart Mobility
- **Artifacts**: Use SDOH to identify heat/medical vulnerability, then implement and track access-to-services mobility plans (shuttle routes, park-and-ride integration, mobility vouchers) with public reporting to increase CPS confidence.

# A cooling center is useless if you can't get there

In high-vulnerability tracts, distance is a health hazard. Building a facility isn't enough—you have to solve the "last mile."

We use SDOH heat vulnerability layers to plan and execute emergency access mobility.

**How it works:**
- **Heat Mapping**: Overlays temperature spikes with elderly and disability census tracts.
- **Route Planning**: Deploys shuttles to bridge the gap during emergencies.
- **Public Reporting**: Tracks accessibility metrics during events to prove effectiveness.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Community** Lifesaving access during climate extremes.
- **Government** Improves resilience scores for the district.
- **Permit Requestor** Demonstrates profound community care.

**Result:** Infrastructure investments actually reach the people they are meant to save.
