# Assets for 2026-T-010: 3-Priority Data Routing

## Needed assets
- [ ] Architecture diagram showing P1 → P2 → P3 routing flow
- [ ] Example showing same question answered at different priority levels
- [ ] Code snippet or config showing advisor model (no tools) vs research model (with tools)

## Notes
- Emphasize the "no tool-calling for primary advisor" as a deliberate security/reliability choice
- Could show latency/cost comparison between P1, P2, P3 responses
- Consider showing the data manifest concept (how context is pre-loaded for P2)
