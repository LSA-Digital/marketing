Permitting agencies do not need another portal.

They need visibility inside the workflow they already run, without buying new government software or expanding headcount.

We built LSARS dashboards that ingest Smart Mobility feeds so agencies can see permit status plus mobility compliance signals in one place.

**How it works:**
- **Ingest**: bring in traffic, parking, and incident-response signals from existing mobility systems.
- **Contextualize**: tie those signals to specific commitments, locations, and permit milestones.
- **Alert + audit**: publish thresholds, exceptions, and resolutions with a trail reviewers can defend.

**Result:** more reviews completed with less manual coordination.
