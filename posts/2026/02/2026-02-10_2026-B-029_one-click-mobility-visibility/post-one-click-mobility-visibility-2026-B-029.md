## Post
Permitting agencies do not need to buy another complex workflow system.

They need visibility inside the workflow they already run, without buying new government software or expanding headcount.

We already have real-world patterns for this: cities share planned closures and incidents to reach drivers fast, and work-zone data standards exist to make authoritative feeds reusable. The gap is tying those signals to permit commitments and review steps.

We built LSARS dashboards that ingest Smart Mobility feeds so agencies can see permit status plus mobility compliance signals in one place.

**How it works:**
- **Ingest**: bring in traffic, parking, and incident-response signals from existing mobility systems.
- **Contextualize**: tie those signals to specific commitments, locations, and permit milestones.
- **Alert + audit**: publish thresholds, exceptions, and resolutions with a trail reviewers can defend.

**Result:** more reviews completed with less manual coordination.
