## Post
Most data center permits do not stall on engineering. They stall on trust and accountability.

We see this pattern in the Erason data center permits: the hard questions are less "can you build it?" and more "what exactly are you committing to, who is accountable if this goes sideways, and how will progress be proven?"

When the objections are about grid costs, water scarcity, noise, land use, and local jobs, vague commitments just create more back-and-forth.

We built LSARS to help permit requestors move faster by turning objections and concerns into measurable commitments with an evidence trail, so stakeholders can verify progress instead of re-litigating claims.

**How it works:**
- **Issue map**: we translate community and agency concerns into specific evidence requirements (what has to be measured, reported, and enforced).
- **Commitment design**: we turn each promise into owners, milestones, and proof requirements.
- **Execution + proof**: commitments become tracked milestones and public scorecards, so stakeholders can verify progress instead of re-litigating claims.

**Result:** fewer surprises, fewer "trust us" debates, and a clearer path to a defensible permit.

If you want to map your project to a pilot-ready plan, book a 20-30 min working session at https://lsars.com.
