## Post
Most data center permits do not stall on engineering. They stall on trust.

When the objections are about grid costs, water scarcity, noise, land use, and "who is accountable if this goes sideways," vague commitments just create more back-and-forth.

We built LSARS to help permit requestors move faster by turning NIMBY concerns into measurable commitments with an evidence trail.

**How it works:**
- **Issue map**: we translate community and agency concerns into specific evidence requirements (what has to be measured, reported, and enforced).
- **Commitment design**: we use baseline HSRA + SDOH context to propose investments that match the local objections (energy affordability, water triggers, noise controls, site buffers).
- **Execution + proof**: commitments become tracked milestones and public scorecards, so stakeholders can verify progress instead of re-litigating claims.

**Result:** fewer surprises, fewer "trust us" debates, and a clearer path to a defensible permit.

If you want to map your project to a pilot-ready plan, book a 20-30 min working session at https://lsars.com.
