## Post
Most data center permits do not stall on engineering. They stall when the project collides with trust, timelines, and the utility upgrade path.

Concrete scenario: a new 50-60MW facility needs power. That often means a substation transformer upgrade plus a short 115kV line extension. Suddenly you're coordinating local grading/building permits, parcel easements, a state DOT encroachment (highway crossing), a railroad crossing package, and (if you touch jurisdictional waters) federal/state water approvals. Different agencies. Different formats. Different clocks.

We built LSARS to help permit requestors move faster by turning that whole stack into a single, auditable workflow: clear dependencies, versioned evidence, and reviewer-ready packages.

**How it works:**
- **Critical path map**: define permits, agencies, crossings, ROW steps, and decision gates so teams stop doing work in the wrong order.
- **Evidence packaging**: ingest core documents, extract key parameters, and produce traceable summaries (with citations back to source).
- **Change control**: when route, load, or assumptions change, we show the delta and keep the evidence trail intact.

**Result:** less churn, fewer surprises, and a faster path to a defensible permit.

If you want to pressure-test your permit path (including the utility upgrade path), book a 20-30 min working session at https://lsars.com.
