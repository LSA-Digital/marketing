Governments are being asked to review more permits, faster (without the headcount they need).  The failure mode isn't effort, it's fragmentation: different documents, different versions of "the truth," and no shared evidence trail.

What we did: we built an AI-enabled workflow that aligns the agency and the applicant around the same evidence—**without requiring the agency to buy or deploy new government software**.

This matters to the people in the middle:

- **Permitting agencies** get a clearer, auditable package they can review faster (and defend later).
- **Permit Applicants** see what's missing earlier, so they can fix issues before the clock (and public trust) runs out.
- **Communities** benefit when decisions are explained with evidence, not just asserted.

The principle is simple: if review capacity is the constraint, the system has to reduce rework - not add another portal nobody can adopt.

If we want visuals for LinkedIn, capture one of these:
- Screenshot/mock of the “shared evidence” review packet structure (redacted)
- Simple diagram: applicant → evidence packet → agency review loop (auditable trail)
- One slide: “No new government software purchase required” (what that means operationally)
