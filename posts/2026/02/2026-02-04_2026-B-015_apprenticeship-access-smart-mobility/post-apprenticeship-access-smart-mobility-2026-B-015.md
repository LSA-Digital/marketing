## Post
“We created jobs” isn’t enough. People have to be able to get to work.

If transportation is the barrier, the real commitment is **workforce access**—and you need evidence that it worked.

Transit agencies are already deploying on-demand, first-mile/last-mile services to close access gaps. If you don’t connect workforce programs to a concrete access plan, participation becomes the weak link.

With the combination of our Health & Social Risk Assessment and Permit Intelligence AI systems, we built a social health metrics-driven way to pair workforce programs with practical transportation support (shuttles, park-and-ride, vouchers) and publish the metrics that make the promise believable.

**How it works:**
- **Detect barriers**: identify where transportation blocks participation.
- **Pair programs with access**: attach mobility options to apprenticeship pathways, for realistic community job training outcomes.
- **Publish outcomes**: completion + usage metrics so commitments don’t dissolve into PR.

**Result:** workforce commitments become measurable, reviewable, and easier to defend in high-trust permitting contexts.

If you’re making workforce promises, we’ll show how to make them transparent and accountable, end-to-end. https://lsars.com

- Barrier analysis mock: where transportation blocks participation
- Mobility support menu (shuttle/park-and-ride/voucher) tied to workforce programs
- Metrics mock: usage + completion + retention proxy measures
