## Post
“We created jobs” isn’t a commitment.

If transportation is the barrier, the real commitment is **workforce access**—and you need evidence that it worked.

We built an SDOH-driven way to pair workforce programs with practical transportation support (shuttles, park-and-ride, vouchers) and publish the metrics that make the promise believable.

**How it works:**
- **Detect barriers**: identify where transportation blocks participation.
- **Pair programs with access**: attach mobility options to apprenticeship pathways.
- **Publish outcomes**: completion + usage metrics so commitments don’t dissolve into PR.

**Result:** workforce commitments become measurable, reviewable, and easier to defend in high-trust permitting contexts.

If you’re making workforce promises, we’ll show how to make them auditable end-to-end. https://lsars.com
