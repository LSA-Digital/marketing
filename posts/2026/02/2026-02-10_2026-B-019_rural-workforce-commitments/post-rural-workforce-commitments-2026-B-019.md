# "Jobs" isn't a magic word—access is

"It creates jobs" is a tired line if locals can't access them due to skills or transport gaps.

The LSA Digital Health & Social Risk Assessment AI Solution builds social metrics-driven workforce targeting to identify and remove barriers to entry for rural communities.

**How it works:**
- **Barrier ID**: Maps transport, childcare, and education gaps in the local labor pool.
- **Support Integration**: Pairs apprenticeships with shuttles or childcare vouchers.
- **Local Spend**: Tracks payroll zip codes to prove local economic impact.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Community** Real jobs for real neighbors, not just fly-in contractors.
- **Permit Requestor** "Economic benefit" becomes an irrefutable fact.
- **Government** Sees actual ROI on tax incentives.

**Result:** Workforce commitments turn from vague promises into transparent, accountable local victories.
