## Post
"Jobs" is not a commitment. Access is.

If the local workforce does not have the credentials, transportation, or training pathway, the jobs story turns into a credibility problem.

We built LSARS to make workforce commitments measurable: training pipeline, cohort progress, and proof that local people actually got hired.

**How it works:**
- **Program definition**: specify the roles, prerequisites, and training path (trades, community college, GED).
- **Cohort tracking**: track enrollment, completion, and supports (so the program is not just announced).
- **Hiring proof**: report outcomes (completions, local hires, local spend) with an auditable trail.

**Result:** workforce commitments become something community members can verify, not just a slogan.

If you want to design a workforce plan that holds up under scrutiny, book a working session at https://lsars.com.
