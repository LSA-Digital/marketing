## Post
Utility projects rarely get delayed by "a permit." They get delayed by the gaps between permits.

Different agencies, different formats, different assumptions, different versions of the truth. The work is real, but the churn is avoidable.

We built LSARS to accelerate utility permitting by turning the permit stack into a single, auditable workflow: clear dependencies, versioned evidence, and reviewer-ready packages.

**How it works:**
- **Permit stack visibility**: define the permits, agencies, dependencies, and decision gates so work does not get redone in the wrong order.
- **Evidence packaging**: ingest core documents, extract key parameters, and produce traceable summaries (with citations back to source).
- **Change control**: when inputs change, we show the delta and keep the audit trail intact.

**Result:** less rework, fewer surprises, and a faster path from "plan" to "reviewable."

If you want to pressure-test your permit path and identify the real blockers, book a working session at https://lsars.com.
