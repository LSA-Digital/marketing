Utility projects rarely get delayed by "a permit." They get delayed by the permits between the permits: crossings, ROW, survey windows, and the handoffs that create rework.

Concrete example (we see this pattern constantly): a substation upgrade plus a ~3-mile 115kV line extension to serve new load. The engineering is straightforward. The schedule risk is the stack around it: city/county permits, a DOT encroachment for the highway crossing, a railroad crossing package, environmental/cultural studies, and parcel-by-parcel easements.

We built LSARS to accelerate utility permitting by turning that stack into a single, auditable workflow: explicit dependencies, versioned evidence, and reviewer-ready packages.

**How it works:**
- **Permit stack visibility**: map permits, agencies, dependencies, and decision gates so the critical path is real (not wishful).
- **Crossing-first evidence**: surface the exhibits and parameters each crossing reviewer needs (DOT/rail/water) and keep them consistent across submittals.
- **Audit-ready changes**: when alignment or methods change, we show the delta and keep the evidence trail intact.

**Result:** less back-and-forth, fewer restarts, and faster approvals without asking reviewers to "trust us."
