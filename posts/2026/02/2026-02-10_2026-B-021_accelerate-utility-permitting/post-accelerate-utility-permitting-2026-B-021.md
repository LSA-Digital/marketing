## Post
Utility projects rarely get delayed by "a permit." They get delayed by the permits between the permits: multi-town coordination, ROW work in public ways, wetlands conditions, and the handoffs that create rework.

Concrete example (from a public docket): the Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project (EFSB 24-01 / D.P.U. 24-135). The filings describe a 3.2-mile underground 115 kV transmission line in Weymouth and Hingham, a new enclosed substation at 0 Old Hobart Street in Hingham, and a new tap station on an Eversource-owned transmission corridor at 0 Broad Street in Weymouth.

That docket is a good illustration of why utility permitting isn't linear. Even for a mostly in-road underground line, the stack includes route selection across municipalities, traffic management built to MassDOT work-zone standards, and wetlands-related permitting (including Orders of Conditions) with HDD crossings called out to reduce impacts. The record also documents an MBTA right-of-way alternative and why railroad operations constraints can add months (or years).

We built LSARS for situations like this by turning the permit stack into a single, auditable workflow: explicit dependencies, versioned evidence, and reviewer-ready packages.

**How it works:**
- **Permit stack visibility**: map permits, agencies, dependencies, and decision gates so the critical path is real (not wishful).
- **ROW + crossing evidence**: surface the exhibits and parameters reviewers need for work in public ways, rail corridors, and water/wetland crossings, and keep them consistent across submittals.
- **Audit-ready changes**: when alignment or methods change, we show the delta and keep the evidence trail intact.

**Result:** less back-and-forth, fewer restarts, and faster approvals without asking reviewers to "trust us."

If you want to map your stack and find the real blockers, book a working session at https://lsars.com.
