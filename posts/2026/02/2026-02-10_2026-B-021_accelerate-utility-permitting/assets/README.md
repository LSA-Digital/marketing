# Assets (Needed)

This post is stronger with one concrete artifact. Suggested captures (redact as needed):

- Dependency map: substation upgrade + ~3-mile 115kV line extension (show crossings and gating items)
- Reviewer-ready evidence packet excerpt (inputs table + citations to source docs)
- Change delta / impact report (alignment change -> impacted permits/exhibits)
