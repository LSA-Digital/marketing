# Notes

Open questions to make this post credible and artifact-first:

- Which utility permitting scenario is this anchored on?
  - Transmission line? Substation? Interconnect? Generation upgrade? Water/wastewater?
- Which agencies are in scope (example stack)?
- What is the concrete artifact to show?
  - Dependency map screenshot, evidence package excerpt, versioned delta view, etc.
- Who is the SME for this post (Nelson / Thad / Mike / other)?
