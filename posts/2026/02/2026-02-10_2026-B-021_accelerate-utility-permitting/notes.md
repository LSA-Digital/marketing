# Notes

Scenario anchor (use across the mini-series):

- Substation upgrade + ~3-mile 115kV line extension to serve a new 50-60MW load
- Typical gating items: DOT encroachment (highway crossing), railroad crossing package, environmental/cultural studies, easements, and seasonal survey windows

Concrete artifacts to make the posts credible (redact as needed):

- Dependency map with the true critical path highlighted (permits + crossings + ROW + survey windows)
- Reviewer-ready evidence packet excerpt with citations back to source docs
- Change delta / impact report (alignment change -> impacted permits/exhibits)

SME alignment:

- Default reviewers/tagging rules live in `lsaProductExpertAlignment.md` (LSARS)
