## Post

"Human-in-the-loop" is often treated like a safety brake.

So teams avoid it.

Then they ship autonomy they can't trust.

The fix is UX, not ideology.

We use repeatable Human-in-the-Loop patterns that scale:

**Patterns that keep speed without losing control:**
- **Approval gates:** an agent can propose actions, but execution is gated for high-risk steps.
- **Review queues:** humans review batches, not interruptions.
- **Escalation levels:** low-risk actions auto-run; medium-risk escalates; high-risk requires explicit approval.
- **Safe defaults:** when uncertain, the system chooses the least harmful action.

This is where Human-UX (HUX) and Agent-UX (AUX) meet:

If the review UI is painful (bad HUX), humans become the bottleneck.

If the agent can't package evidence, explain intent, and request the right approval (bad AUX), review becomes guesswork.

The critical design choice: **design the review experience as a product surface.** That's how CI/CD can move fast without shipping surprises.
