- **Status**: draft
- **Type**: Business
- **Expert**: Keith Mangold + Nelson Smith
- **Product**: LSARS, Smart Mobility
- **Artifacts**: Ingest Smart Mobility feeds into LSARS dashboards so agencies can see permit status + traffic/parking compliance + incident response signals without buying new government software.

# Small agencies shouldn't fly blind

Small permitting agencies can't afford big traffic command centers. They shouldn't have to to manage a large project.

We ingest Smart Mobility feeds into LSARS so agencies get situational awareness for free.

**How it works:**
- **Unified Dashboard**: Permit status alongside live traffic and parking signals.
- **Incident Detection**: Automated alerts for congestion anomalies near the site.
- **No-Cost Access**: The permit applicant covers the platform cost as part of the application.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Government** Sophisticated monitoring without the procurement nightmare.
- **Permit Requestor** Faster approvals from confident, informed agencies.

**Result:** Agencies get the visibility they need to say "yes" without blowing their budget.
