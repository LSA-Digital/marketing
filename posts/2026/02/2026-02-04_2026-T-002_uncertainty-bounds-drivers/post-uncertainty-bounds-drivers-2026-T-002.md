## Post

If a model can’t tell you why a number moved, the number isn’t “smart.” It’s dangerous.

We built uncertainty into the workflow on purpose: **bounds + drivers**, not false precision.

We applied this in LSARS permitting workflows—where timelines, investments, and trust all get punished when uncertainty is hidden.

Key supporting details:
- **Quantify uncertainty when it matters**: return a bounded estimate and the top drivers, not just a single score.
- **Keep answers auditable**: make it easy to see what evidence was used and what assumptions were applied.
- **Escalate safely**: keep the primary advisor read-only and only escalate to deeper research when governed context is insufficient.

Result: stakeholders get fewer surprises, engineering gets fewer “rewrite this for audit” cycles, and decisions get easier to defend.

## Claim boundaries
- Stage: in progress
- What we can say safely:
  - We quantify uncertainty with bounds + drivers
  - We keep answering bounded and auditable and escalate research intentionally
- What we should NOT claim:
  - Perfect predictions
  - “No hallucinations”
  - Specific accuracy metrics without measured evidence

## Notes (optional)
- Repost kit:
  - Business caption: "False precision is expensive. Bounds + drivers make decisions defensible."
  - Technical caption: "Uncertainty isn’t a weakness—it’s a requirement. Return bounds + drivers, keep answers auditable, and escalate research intentionally."
  - Partner voice caption: "We build trust by making uncertainty explicit."
- Question prompt: "When your system is uncertain, do you show it—or hide it behind a single number?"
