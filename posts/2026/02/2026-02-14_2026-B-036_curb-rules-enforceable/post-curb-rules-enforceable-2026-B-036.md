## Post
The curb is where a project meets real life: drop-offs, deliveries, loading, staging, and emergency access.

Permits often include curb-related conditions (delivery windows, no-parking zones, designated loading). The failure mode is when those conditions stay implicit, unmeasured, and unenforced.

Real-world example: Washington, DC combined curb inventory and enforcement in a commercial loading zone management program to improve loading zone availability and reduce double parking. DDOT also publishes loading zone rules and operating hours so curb access is predictable.

And curb rules are increasingly describable as structured policy data (e.g., the Curb Data Specification), which makes enforcement and public reporting scalable.

We built Smart Mobility + LSARS workflows that treat curb policy like an executable rulebook: clear rules, measurable compliance, and a public resolution trail.

**How it works:**
- **Inventory the curb**: capture curb uses and constraints (loading, ADA, bus zones, fire lanes) at the block level.
- **Publish a rulebook**: define who can do what, where, and when - including project-specific exceptions.
- **Measure + resolve**: tie occupancy, violations, and complaints to corrective actions and closure.

**Why this matters:**
- **Communities** get quality-of-life protections they can verify without fighting for attention.
- **Permit requestors** avoid "death by a thousand curb conflicts" that drags timelines.
- **Agencies** get enforceable conditions without turning every issue into a bespoke escalation.

**Result:** fewer spillover fights, fewer blocked-access incidents, and a simpler compliance story.

If you want curb conditions that are enforceable (not aspirational), book a working session at https://lsars.com.
