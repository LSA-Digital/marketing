# How does LSARS make water use and drought triggers transparent (potable vs reclaimed)?

- **ID**: 2026-B-016

- **Type**: Business
- **Artifacts**: Publish a simple public water dashboard (caps, potable vs reclaimed, drought-trigger operating rules, compliance history) so the community isn't asked to rely on verbal assurances.

# Water transparency that communities can verify

Verbal assurances about data center water use don't build trust - data does. When communities fear drought impact, "we promise to be efficient" isn't enough.

We built the LSARS Water Use Dashboard to turn drought triggers and reclamation commitments into public, verifiable records.

**How it works:**
- **Drought Triggers**: Automatic operating rule adjustments based on state drought levels.
- **Source Tracking**: Real-time split between potable and reclaimed water usage.
- **Compliance History**: Public log of cap adherence.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Community** Stops relying on "trust us" and starts verifying.
- **Government** Automates compliance monitoring without new staff.
- **Permit Requestor** Proves responsible stewardship with hard numbers.

**Result:** Permits move faster when water impact is a known quantity, not a black box.
