### Water transparency that communities can verify

Verbal assurances about data center water use don't build trust - data does. When communities fear drought impact, "we promise to be efficient" isn't enough.

We built the LSARS Water Use Dashboard to turn drought triggers and reclamation commitments into public, verifiable records.

**How it works:**
- **Drought Triggers**: Automatic operating rule adjustments based on state drought levels.
- **Source Tracking**: Real-time split between potable and reclaimed water usage.
- **Compliance History**: Public log of cap adherence.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Community** Stops relying on "trust us" and starts verifying.
- **Government** Automates compliance monitoring without new staff.
- **Permit Requestor** Proves responsible stewardship with hard numbers.

**Result:** Permits move faster when water impact is a known quantity, not a black box.

Real-world example: Tucson's City Council unanimously killed the proposed "Project Blue" data center amid concerns about water use. Tucson then adopted an ordinance requiring large water-use applications to become public records and to go through a mayor-and-council vote.
