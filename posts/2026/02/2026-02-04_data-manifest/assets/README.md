# Assets checklist (2026-T-006)

No assets have been created for this post yet.

Good artifacts for engineers:
- A 1-page data manifest template (field name, meaning, units, source, constraints, examples)
- “Before/after” example: same prompt with/without manifest (showing why implicit semantics fails)
- Diagram: domain dataset → manifest → model context → provenance in answer
