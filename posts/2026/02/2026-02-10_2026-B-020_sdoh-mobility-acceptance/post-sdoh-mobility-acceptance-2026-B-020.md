# Mobility investments fail when they ignore reality

"We added a bus stop" is useless if the community needs wheelchair vans. Mobility investments fail when they don't match community reality.

We integrated SDOH data to target mobility investments where they are needed most—and where they will be accepted.

**How it works:**
- **Vulnerability Mapping**: Highlights no-vehicle households, language isolation, and disability concentrations.
- **Targeted Interventions**: Recommends specific solutions (shuttles, multilingual wayfinding) based on identified gaps.
- **Trust Building**: Demonstrates understanding of local needs beyond generic "improvements".

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Community** Gets useful infrastructure that solves daily struggles, not just checkboxes.
- **Permit Requestor** Reduces opposition by solving real problems for neighbors.
- **Government** Sees equitable investment of permit fees.

**Result:** Mobility becomes a community asset, not a gentrification signal.
