## Post

Developing all the technical details of a permit is typically complex work performed by consultants, with slow output: pick a design, submit the paperwork, and hope you didn't just lock in a timeline (and a risk profile) you can't defend.

We have a workflow to do this at least 100x faster, with more flexiblity:  when a baseline permit PDF can is uploaded, with AI extracts operational parameters and other key details.  Then, the AI permit scenario accelerator can build scenarios *hundreds of times*—with an auditable "delta from baseline risk" view each time.

This matters because it changes who can participate, and when:

- Permit requestors can explore mitigation options before they've committed capital to the wrong plan.
- Regulators (e.g., permitting agencies) can see assumptions and deltas—not just an end-state claim.
- Community leadership can evaluate enforceable commitments with clearer tradeoffs.

The shift isn't "more AI." It's *cheaper iteration with receipts*—so permitting conversations move from arguments to scenarios.

If you're stuck in the cycle of "one model run → one report → one fight," book a working session with us at `https://lsars.com`.
