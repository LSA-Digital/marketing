Regulators in California use different standards than the EPA. State agencies have different documentation requirements than federal ones. And "compliant" means something different in each context.

**The problem isn't meeting standards—it's proving you met them in a way each reviewer can verify.**

LSARS doesn't just run calculations. It generates contextual reports that explain the methodology, shows the math, and cites the exact regulatory standard or peer-reviewed research behind each step. Different agency? Different report format. Same underlying rigor.

Why this matters:

- **Permit reviewers** see calculations they can trace back to authoritative sources, not black-box outputs
- **Permit applicants** reduce back-and-forth by answering "how did you calculate this?" before asked
- **Communities** get documentation they can trust because it's the same documentation the agency sees

Static audit reports work for stable, single-jurisdiction environments. But when you're navigating EPA vs. OEHHA modes, or state-specific requirements, you need dynamic reports that adapt context without sacrificing transparency.

**Compliance isn't about passing a checklist. It's about building trust through documentation that any stakeholder can verify.**
