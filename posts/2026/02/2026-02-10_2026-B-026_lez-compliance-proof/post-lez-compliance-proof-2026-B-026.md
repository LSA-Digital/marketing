# Low Emission Zones need more than a sign

Low Emission Zones (LEZ) are often just rules on paper. Without enforcement, they are ignored.

We connect access control systems to public scorecards to prove LEZ compliance.

**How it works:**
- **Gated Access**: Validates vehicle emission class at entry.
- **Public Logs**: Anonymized counts of compliant vs non-compliant attempts.
- **Trend Analysis**: Shows improvement over time to prove policy effectiveness.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Government** "Green" policies that actually work.
- **Community** Measurable air quality protection they can verify.
- **Permit Requestor** Automates compliance reporting.

**Result:** LEZ rules become physical reality, not just regulatory aspirations.
