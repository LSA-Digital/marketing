## Post
A data center can have a strong permit package and still miss the schedule for one reason: labor.

If the local workforce doesn't exist (or can't access the jobs), the jobs story turns into a credibility problem. And a credibility problem becomes a permitting problem.

We built the LSARS Permit Location Optimizer to help permit requestors select a site *and* plan the build: compare potential zones not only on permitability risk, but on build conditions like workforce readiness.

In LSARS-532, we describe a simple example: County A has a deep bench of experienced electricians. County B has fewer electricians today, but a stronger pool of people who could complete an apprenticeship.

If you need to build now, you prioritize County A and design a recruiting plan. If your timeline allows training, you can prioritize County B, fund the pipeline, and prove the local benefit with outcomes.

**How it works:**
- **Workforce readiness**: quantify skilled-trade depth (electricians, plumbing, construction) at the tract/county level.
- **Train vs recruit scenarios**: model the path to staff the build (timeline, constraints, and community impact) instead of hand-waving it.
- **Proof of local benefit**: track cohorts and hiring outcomes so "local jobs" becomes verifiable, not aspirational.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Permit Requestor** De-risks the schedule by treating labor as a first-class constraint.
- **Communities** Get real access pathways, not fly-in crews and vague promises.
- **Governments** Get measurable outcomes tied to incentives and approvals.

**Result:** labor supply stops being a late-stage surprise and becomes a defensible plan in the permit record.
