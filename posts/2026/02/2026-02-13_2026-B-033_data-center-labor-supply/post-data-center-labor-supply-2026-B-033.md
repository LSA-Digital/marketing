A data center can have a strong permit package and still miss the schedule for one reason: labor.

If the local workforce doesn't exist (or can't access the jobs), the jobs story turns into a credibility problem. And a credibility problem becomes a permitting problem.

Real-world example: CBS News reports data centers are expanding and competing with factories for electricians, HVAC techs, and other trades, while roughly 400,000 skilled-trade jobs are currently unfilled in the U.S. In that market, "local jobs" needs a train-vs-recruit plan and proof of outcomes.

We built the LSARS Permit Location Optimizer to help permit requestors select a site *and* plan the build: compare Potentially Optimal Permit Zones with a Community Permitability Score, plus build conditions like workforce readiness.

In one county, there is a deep bench of experienced electricians. In another, there are fewer electricians today, but a stronger pool of people who could complete an apprenticeship.

If you need to build now, you prioritize County A and design a recruiting plan. If your timeline allows training, you can prioritize County B, fund the pipeline, and prove the local benefit with outcomes.

LSARS turns that choice into a measurable plan: training pathways, recruiting execution, and proof that local people actually got hired.

**How it works:**
- **Workforce readiness**: quantify skilled-trade depth (electricians, plumbing, construction) and near-term training capacity at the tract/county level.
- **Train vs recruit scenarios**: build a concrete staffing plan (apprenticeships and supports vs. targeted recruiting) that matches your timeline.
- **Proof of local benefit**: track cohorts and hiring outcomes so "local jobs" becomes verifiable, not aspirational.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Permit Requestor** De-risks the schedule by treating labor as a first-class constraint.
- **Communities** Get real access pathways, not fly-in crews and vague promises.
- **Governments** Get measurable outcomes tied to incentives and approvals.

**Result:** labor supply stops being a late-stage surprise and becomes a defensible plan in the permit record.
