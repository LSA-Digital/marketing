# How does LSARS handle diesel backup generator credibility (construction + testing) with HSRA baseline risk?

- **ID**: 2026-B-018
- **Date**: 2026-02-10
- **Status**: draft
- **Type**: Business
- **Expert**: Nelson Smith + Mike Idengren
- **Product**: LSARS, HSRA
- **Artifacts**: Even if normal operations are clean, diesel backup and construction emissions can be politically material in high-burden tracts. LSARS anchors the conversation in baseline HSRA + cumulative burden and tracks mitigation/compliance transparently.

# Credibility means counting the backup generators too

"Clean" data centers still have diesel backups. Ignoring them destroys credibility. Communities know they exist, so we track them.

We integrated diesel backup testing schedules and construction emissions into the HSRA baseline model.

**How it works:**
- **Cumulative Burden**: Models backup emissions on top of existing community pollution load.
- **Testing Windows**: Schedules testing for low-impact times, enforced by the system.
- **Mitigation Tracking**: Logs filter upgrades and runtime limits.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Community** Sees the *whole* picture, not just the "clean" days.
- **Government** Ensures emergency prep doesn't violate air quality goals.
- **Permit Requestor** Builds trust by acknowledging reality.

**Result:** Credibility is maintained by acknowledging and managing the dirty parts of clean infra.
