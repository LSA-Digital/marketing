## Post
Credibility means counting the backup generators, too.

"Clean" data centers still have diesel backups. Communities know they exist, so we track them.

We integrated diesel backup testing schedules and construction emissions into the HSRA baseline model.

**How it works:**
- **Cumulative Burden**: Models backup emissions on top of existing community pollution load.
- **Testing Windows**: Schedules testing for low-impact times, enforced by the system.
- **Mitigation Tracking**: Logs filter upgrades and runtime limits.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Community** Sees the *whole* picture, not just the "clean" days.
- **Government** Ensures emergency prep doesn't violate air quality goals.
- **Permit Requestor** Builds trust by acknowledging reality.

**Result:** Credibility is maintained by acknowledging and managing the dirty parts of clean infra.

Real-world example: Virginia DEQ's APG-576 sets minimum permit expectations for diesel engine-generator sets, and a 2026 proposed revision adds presumptive BACT requirements for generators at data center stationary sources.
