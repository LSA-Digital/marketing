## Post
Most “community benefit” plans fail for one simple reason: you can’t tell *who* benefited, *when*, or *whether it matched the need*.

We built an SDOH-driven workflow to turn energy affordability promises into **targeted commitments** you can track by neighborhood.

**How it works:**
- **Find the pressure points**: identify high energy-burden areas (where bill increases hit hardest).
- **Define commitments that can be audited**: weatherization, HVAC upgrades, bill credits—each with measurable delivery.
- **Publish delivery by tract**: show what was delivered, where, and how outcomes are being monitored.

**Why this matters for stakeholders:**
- **Communities** get proof—not slogans—that commitments are landing where the burden is real.
- **Permit requestors** reduce surprise resistance by aligning investments to measurable needs.
- **Reviewers** get a defensible record they can validate without taking anyone’s word for it.

If you’re negotiating (or reviewing) community commitments, we can show what it looks like to make them verifiable end-to-end. Book a working session at https://lsars.com
