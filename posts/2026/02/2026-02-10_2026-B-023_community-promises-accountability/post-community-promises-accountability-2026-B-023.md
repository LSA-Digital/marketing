Promises do not build trust. Proof does.

The fastest way to lose a community is to make commitments that live in PDFs and die in inboxes.

We built LSARS with a community portal that shows promises vs. delivery: spending, milestones, outcomes, and a public resolution trail.

**How it works:**
- **Structured commitments**: convert Community Benefit Agreement (CBA) language into trackable records (what, when, who owns it).
- **Evidence trail**: attach proof (documents, monitoring data, approvals) so the record is defensible.
- **Scorecards + resolution**: publish progress and close the loop on complaints with an audit trail.

**Result:** stakeholders stop arguing about what was promised and start verifying what was delivered.

If you want to see what accountability looks like in a real permitting workflow, book a working session at https://lsars.com.
