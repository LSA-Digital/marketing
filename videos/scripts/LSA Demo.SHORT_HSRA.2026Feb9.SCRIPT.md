Video script:  LSA Demo.SHORT Health & Social Risk Assessment 2026 Feb 9
 
## Scene 1:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
Welcome to our Community Health & Social Risk Assessment demo. Today, we're going to talk about how we make it easy to understand community health and social risk, which helps with smart allocation of resources and follow-up care.
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
Now, let's dive right in. I'll turn it over to Mike Idengren, who will start with an overview of the pollutant and health screening capabilities.
 
## Scene 2:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
 Thanks Keith. When we first enter the system, we can see a map of the United States. This is the entire set of data from the EPA, and what we're doing is we're able to apply either EPA or California's OEHHA standards to the analysis for any of these states, counties, or tracks.
 
## Scene 3:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
 I'm going to click on the state of Tennessee, and then click on Nashville. When I click on Nashville, we see a map of Davidson County, and in Davidson County we see that the total population is seven hundred fifteen thousand eight hundred and eighty four.
 
## Scene 4:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
So we can see in the legend that the map is in California's OEHHA mode, and that's going to give us better precision metrics. You can see that in the middle of the tract, there are high cancer rates: 706 to 780 per million in these tracks here, and then less as we get out from the center. Trucks are running through and there's lots of inner city pollution so that's a pretty typical pattern.
 
## Scene 5:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
So to show the difference here between California's mode and EPA, if I switch this to EPA, we'll see that we get some information that is a little different. Colors are less detailed than California's mode, and it doesn't include the diesel particulate matter in their calculations, which is one reason why EPA has such a lower amount of cancer reported per million in broader buckets.
 
## Scene 6:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
Thanks Mike, that was a great overview of the Health Risk Assessment system! Now, let's see an overview of the Social Vulnerability Index. Can you tell us why that's important?
**Speaker:** Mike Idengren
 Sure, Keith. A community that already has health risks will be even more vulnerable to disease and healthcare costs -- for example, if they don't have vehicle access, then it's difficult to get to the doctor for prevention or treatment -- and that causes medical conditions to get even worse.
 
## Scene 7:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
All right, so next up we're going to briefly demo social vulnerability. We left off last time looking at the map of Davidson County with pollution and cancer rates, and now we see the social vulnerability option. I'm going to turn that on and the map is going to turn blue. So, now we can see the darker areas contain more socially vulnerable people than the lighter areas.
 
## Scene 8:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
Note that certain parts of the county are more socially vulnerable than others. So you can click and see that vehicle access maybe is worse in the inner city area, but not as much on the outskirts. So, focused investments in Smart Mobility or more bus routes might be more helpful in darker areas than lighter ones.
 
## Scene 9:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
 When a community is exposed to high baseline pollutants and resulting cancer risk, and they don't have the ability to get medical care because of social vulnerability factors, that makes things worse. Next, we will show Estimated Financial Burden for a community, both with and without Social Determinant of Health adjustments.
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
 
 
## Scene 10:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
 So we were just looking at the social vulnerability of Davidson County and now we want to understand a little bit more about the financial burden. Previously, we understood that it's a high-risk and high vulnerability area in Davidson County with some key socioeconomic concerns. Now we want to understand what the financial burden is to the community resulting from that pollution and those social factors.
 
## Scene 11:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
To calculate the Estimated Financial Burden, we use a standard Cost of Illness method. This formula accommodates a switch that shows financial adjustment from a social health perspective. Here, we can see it went up to 477 million dollars over the lifetime of these residents. So, we can see that the social factors do make the estimated burdens worse for the community based on the amount of pollution that they are ingesting or breathing in.
 
## Scene 12:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
 Thanks Mike, it's really powerful to understand how the community can be even more financially burdened when they are socially vulnerable. But now, I have a different question: How do we know all the information in the Health & Social Risk Assessment is regulatory aligned? How do people trust the data?
**Speaker:** Mike Idengren
 Thanks Keith, that is an important question we need to answer head-on: Agentic AI solutions need accurate, relevant underlying data, and it is important that the underlying data and calculations are regulatory-aligned. For the data layer, we have a combination of in-line citations and map-context regulatory reports. Let me show you what I mean:
**Speaker:** Mike Idengren
 
 
## Scene 13:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
Now, switching to LA county, and we want to understand where this information came from and how is it defensible. So throughout the side panel over here, we can see validation buttons. So I can validate data, the health calculations, social vulnerability, and so on. I'm going to click on this button here, and then it's going to come up with a data validation box.
 
## Scene 14:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
So for example, we can see that if I click on the estimated financial burden and I want to see a live view, I'm going to go ahead and click on view report. And what it's going to do is generate that report in context of just LA County.
 
## Scene 15:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
Furthermore, it's not enough just to show the calculations. It's important to show where the numbers are coming from and how they are regulatory aligned. So in this case, in step 2 when we're applying threshold-based multipliers, we can see inputs and thresholds exceeded and so on. But even more importantly, we can see the citations.
 
## Scene 16:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
Thanks Mike, it is important to have confidence in the numbers, and understand the sources. So, you mentioned an AI Agent before. What insight does it give us, and how can we trust the AI not to hallucinate on us?
**Speaker:** Mike Idengren
 This is an important question that shows how we use the regulatory-aligned data to avoid AI hallucination and trust what the AI is telling us. We have a multi-AI Agent mixture-of-experts architecture behind the scenes that ensures the right mix of national, state, local and other external information is combined to provide actionable advice. Let me show you what I mean:
**Speaker:** Mike Idengren
 
 
## Scene 17:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
All right, so we were just exploring Los Angeles County, but now we're going to zoom out and we're going to head over back to Tennessee. And we're going to look at Nashville. We're going to click on the chatbot, and now we're in Nashville area, which in Davidson County, Tennessee. We can see that there's some default questions that we can ask a chatbot. So, we're going to click on this question: "What investments would have had the most impact on reducing cancer risk and improving Community Health?" So the chatbot thinks a minute and then it makes some recommendations. It knows that diesel particulate matter is the biggest polluter, total of a third of the cancer risk. It's recommending mobile health and screening units, so addressing 48% of the tracts with low food and service access.
 
## Scene 18:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
And it's suggesting an indoor quality program and integrated Behavioral Health. It provides a little table of some of the key data that it's using to make the interpretations. If we click, we can actually get more detail and write-ups to understand a little bit more about those recommendations and crucially, the sources that those recommendations come from such as EPA, ATSDR, Air Tox Screen, and Tennessee Department of Health.
