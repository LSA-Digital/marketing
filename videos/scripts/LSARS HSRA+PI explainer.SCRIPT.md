## Scene 1:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
Welcome to our LSARS Community Health & Permit Acceleration solution. I'm Keith Mangold, a lead developer for LSARS. Today, we're going to explain the concepts, metrics and outcomes that help deliver a win-win for everyone: permit requestors, the community, and government. Our LSARS Permit Acceleration solution can be used for any kind of permit or location, but today we will focus on examples of Data Centers and Smart Mobility in the U.S.
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mike Idengren, one of three Principals and Chief Technology Officer at Apex Environmental Resolution Group.
 
## Scene 2:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
 Thank you Keith. First, let's talk about the typical problems with data centers. While they don't put off the kind of pollutant emissions like utilities or oil refineries might, communities tend to push back about things like more power and water use, which might lead to higher power bills or water conservation protests. Data Centers also make a low-frequency humming noise, which annoys local residents. Even if permit requestors make promises to invest in the community or put in stronger control technologies, there is a fundamental lack of trust: communities have heard this before, and don't trust that the promises will be fulfilled. The outcome is a typical sentiment: NIMBY, also known as Not In My Backyard.

 The two things needed to solve the problems are trust and speed, and more community trust will result in faster permit approval. Executives do not like uncertainty, and LSARS helps them have better confidence, so they can "set a date" and get a permit approved.
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
 The LSARS system calculates the confidence of hitting that date with what we call the "Community Permitability Score". A higher CPS score equals higher confidence of hitting the desired permit approval date.
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
The Apex Environmental Resolution Group uses both the LSARS technology and consulting services to achieve better trust and speed. LSARS does this by first collecting information about the community, such as its Health & Social Risk Assessment (HSRA). As part of the initial Apex consulting engagement, LSARS HSRA configuration is led by Dr. Thad Perry and his team, using the optimal set of national, state, and local data. This data sets the stage for analysis outcomes such as local pollutant concentrations, resulting cancer rates, and social health metrics.
 
## Scene 4:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
When we know the health outcomes, Nelson Smith and his team of community economic incentive experts collaborates with the community, and fine-tunes the LSARS Permit Intelligence Portal to predict the most effective community investments. For example, if the social health "Lack of Transportation" metric is high for a community, then they may have difficulty getting to work, or to the doctor. In turn, that causes higher medical costs, and worse local economic conditions. To solve these kind of problems, smart mobility and additional bus route funding might be an important incentive for the community.
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
Other metrics can include lack of local high school degrees and shortage for trade skills, such as electricians, plumbers, and construction expertise. Taken together, these metrics help make recommendations for overall strategic workforce investment priorities - which are important for the data centers that executives are trying to get approved.
 
## Scene 5:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
 These community investments, AI-accelerated workflow and dashboard insights help low-budget governments accelerate the permitting process. These tools and a "community forum dashboard" create transparency and accountability, building the bridge and improving the Community Permitability Score. Besides a faster permit approval, some example outcomes might include benefits for the community, such as more people trained, more General Education Diplomas issued, and more medical conditions treated.
