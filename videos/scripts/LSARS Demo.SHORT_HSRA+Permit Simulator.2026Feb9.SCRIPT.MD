## Scene 1:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
Welcome to our LSARS Health & Social Risk + Permit Acceleration solution. Today, we're going to talk about how we help accelerate permits at a high level, and then show a brief overview of how the Agentic AI software works. Our LSARS Permit Acceleration solution can be used for any kind of permit or location, but today we will focus on examples of Data Centers and Smart Mobility in the U.S.
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
Before we get into the system demo, I will turn it over to Mike Idengren to briefly explain LSARS and Apex Environmental Resolution Group leadership team, and what they do.
 
## Scene 2:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
 Thanks for that great intro, Keith. Briefly, the Apex Environmental Resolution Group is a U S LLC led by three principals and a network of partners. Our mission is to deliver faster permit approvals and healthier, more economically prosperous communities. Our family of technology products is called LSARS, which stands for the Life Science Analysis and Reporting Solution. I'm the Chief Technology Officer, and I'm joined here by Doctor Thad Perry, our Chief Health and Informatics Officer, and Nelson Smith, our Chief Community Officer.
 
## Scene 3:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
 So Mike, before we get into the system demo, can you tell us more about the Health and Social Risk Assessment? How do we determine community ground conditions, and why is that important?
**Speaker:** Mike Idengren
 Thanks for that question, Keith. The Health and Social Risk Assessment will cover local community pollutants, cancer rates, and social health conditions. Throughout this demo, we'll show you why these health and social metrics are important for any kind of permitting project -- even for those that may only marginally increase baseline community pollution (such as data centers).
**Speaker:** Mike Idengren
Briefly, the reason baseline community health is important is because pollutants make people sick, and some are carcinogens, causing cancer. People will already have a baseline of pollutants and cancer risk in a community, and if a permit is going to add more pollutants, that might cause even more cancer. Socially disadvantaged people in a community might not have transportation or insurance to get the medical help they need, and that causes even more health and financial burden on the community. So, generally, if a community gets the right incentives, they will see "something in it for us", and show less opposition to permits - even if the permit requestor will cause minor increased pollution.
 
## Scene 4:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
 Thanks for that brief overview, Mike. Now, we'd like to put it all together, by showing the shorter version of our website simulator demo. It combines a miniature version of the Health & Social Risk Assessment system with the Permit Intelligence Portal.
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
First, we're going to simulate how Doctor Perry's AI avatar will advise on Health and Social Risk Assessment metrics to provide targeted advice for a specific kind of permit project.
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
Then, we're going to show how the Permit Intelligence Portal will use Nelson Smith's AI avatar to advise on the right kind of community investments and AI workflow tools that will give better confidence of hitting the desired permit approval date.
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Bkgr
You will see how our human experts combine their experience with AI analysis. The ultimate outcome is to drive a higher Community Permitability Score, reinforcing that it's in everyone's best interest if the permit is approved faster.
 
## Scene 5:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
All right, so we are at the community permit ability simulation lab and here we're going to simulate the speed of a permit for a data center that is in 37211, which is a ZIP code in Nashville, Tennessee. So what we can see here after entering that zip code is the first health & social risk assessment. Dr Perry is telling us that the heaviest concentration of the pollutants is Diesel and that's putting our community at cancer risk of 602 per million. We've got a 61st percentile vulnerability in the nation and a lifetime financial burden of 56 million. And sure enough, looking at this map of the zip code in Nashville, we can see that there are 3 intervention priorities recommended based on the social health especially, which is has a lot of blue and dark blue.
 
## Scene 6:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
So what we can see here are recommended intervention priorities such as mobile Health Access, deploying mobile Health Care units for screening and preventive care, Healthcare navigation to help people actually get to Insurance enrollment, and language services. So these are all kind of intervention priorities that are based on the social determinants of Health.
 
## Scene 7:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
And remember, the pollution and cancer is aggravated by poor social determinants of Health, which makes it worse and ultimately causes more health and financial burden for the community overall.
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
Now Keith, over to you.
 
## Scene 8:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Trans
 Thanks, Mike. So, we just finished our analysis of the health & social risk assessment for this ZIP code in Nashville, and now we're going to go down to our next step, which is to improve the permit outcomes. So when we scroll down, we can see the permit intelligence area and we can see Nelson telling us that the community permeability score is going to predict the permit approval likelihood based on the HSRA data and the proposed investments.
 
## Scene 9:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Trans
So what we're going to do now: We can see that the Baseline CPS, that is our chance of hitting approval in 9 months, is currently 29% with a range of 20% to 41%. We want to make that better, so we're going to click to view our options for a better score.
 
## Scene 10:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Trans
And we can see for example, we could implement more hiring and training programs. All right, and that's going to have an impact that Nelson's going to tell us about. We could also implement more health support, and that is particularly relevant because of the mobile health access and healthcare navigation that were recommended as intervention priorities.
 
## Scene 11:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Trans
So we're going to turn that on and that's going to get us to 46% chance of approval in 9 months. Then we're going to stack on Transit and smart mobility, and that was also a priority because of the mobile health access that was recommended: deploying mobile Health units for screening and preventive care because folks can't get to the doctor as much as they should be able to.
 
## Scene 12:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Trans
So we're going to turn that on and now we can see that our chance of approval in 9 months is 58%. So we're going to add on some L SARS acceleration and transparency tools, which is going to help and move the administration process faster and reassure the community with transparency and accountability.
 
## Scene 13:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Trans
So for example, government can have dashboards so they can see AI analysis of the heavy permit documentations and make faster decisions. We're going to add AI workflow so the permit requests or the commercial entities and the government agencies can work faster together. And then we're going to add a community forum for that transparency.
 
## Scene 14:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Trans
Adding transparency adds that element of accountability, so now we're at 73% likelihood because of all the actions that we've taken, the investments that we've made, and the smart AI tooling that we've implemented. This is going to predict 240 jobs and an estimated 10 million investment in the community.
 
## Scene 15:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Trans
With accountability outcomes, we expect to see more skilled workers trained. We expect to see 3 new bus routes, and we expect to see 10,000 conditions treated. With the right investments and AI-accelerated tools, we reinforce community trust with transparency and accountability.
 
## Scene 16:
**Speaker:** Keith WH/Standing Trans
And that is the key to unlocking major blockers that get in the way of a permit. And we can see the workflow right here: this permanent approval pathway tells a story: project is started and there's a risk assessment with the help of three L SARS accelerator tools. We invest in 3 out of 4 community projects, the community can see everything in their community dashboard, we gain better community trust, and the permit is approved faster.
 
## Scene 17:
**Speaker:** Mike BL/Head Trans
 So, this has been a brief demo, but we have a full map navigator application that allows for detailed permit and community health risk analysis. There's more detail that we won't get into right now, but major emphasis points are EPA and California's O-E-H-H-A mode flexibility, full regulatory reporting and live reports, and A-I system features with anti-hallucination protection. These are examples that show how we can configure a reliable LSARS solution for any state, local, or international jurisdiction.
