## Instructions for Post Index Maintenance

### Post ID System

**Format**: `YYYY-T-NNN`

| Component | Meaning           | Values                                               |
| --------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `YYYY`  | Year              | 2026, 2027, ...                                      |
| `T`     | Type/Channel      | `B` = Business (LSARS), `T` = Tech (LSA Digital) |
| `NNN`   | Sequential number | 001, 002, ... (resets each year per type)            |

**Next IDs**:

- Next business post:`2026-B-011`
- Next tech post:`2026-T-011`

### Channel Strategy

| Type                   | Channel     | LinkedIn Page                                                                | Audience                                                     | Content Focus                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **B** (Business) | LSARS       | [linkedin.com/company/lsars](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lsars)            | Permit requestors, regulators, community leaders, executives | "What we do" — outcomes, trust, stakeholder value                 |
| **T** (Tech)     | LSA Digital | [linkedin.com/company/lsadigital](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lsadigital/) | AI/tech audience, architects, engineers, QA                  | "How we did it" — AI best practices, architecture, implementation |

**Dependency pattern**: Tech posts (`T`) typically repost/expand on a business post (`B`) to show the implementation behind the outcome. The `Depends On` column links them.

### Workflow

1. **Create business post** (`B`) for LSARS channel — focus on stakeholder outcomes
2. **Create tech post** (`T`) for LSA Digital channel — reference business post, explain "how"

### Status Definitions

| Status        | Meaning                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `draft`     | Initial creation, not yet reviewed   |
| `in_review` | Sent to SME reviewer(s) for feedback |
| `approved`  | SME approved, ready to publish       |
| `published` | Live on LinkedIn                     |

### Adding a Post

Use `/new-post` command, which will:

1. Create the post folder and file
2. Add a row to the Post Index table above
3. Increment the "Next IDs" counters

### Related Files

- `posts/README.md` — folder structure standards
- `lsaProductExpertAlignment.md` — SME reviewers and tagging rules
- `marketingCampaignFeb2026.md` — campaign context and goals
