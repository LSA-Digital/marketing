**Dependency pattern**: Tech posts (`T`) typically repost/expand on a business post (`B`) to show the implementation behind the outcome. The `Depends On` column links them; `Relationship` explains why.

### Workflow

1. **Create business post** (`B`) for LSARS channel — focus on stakeholder outcomes
2. **Create tech post** (`T`) for LSA Digital channel — reference business post, explain "how"
