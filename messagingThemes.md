# Messaging Themes

Key Messaging Themes Updated 2026-02-12

| Theme Label              | Product     | Theme (Plain Language)                                                   | What It Means / When To Use |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| SHARED_BENEFIT           | LSARS       | We are all in this together                                              | Frame permitting as a shared win: permit requestor + community both benefit when approvals move faster and commitments deliver. |
| DASHBOARD_ACCOUNTABILITY | LSARS       | Trust + accountability before communities give up leverage               | Make follow-through visible (e.g., a Community Dashboard / portal scorecard) so commitments can be tracked, verified, and enforced. |
| LOCATION_INTELLIGENCE    | LSARS       | Fast, accurate community data for siting + planning                      | Speed and reliability of baseline data matter for planning the right permit location: health conditions, local economy and labor supply, traffic patterns. |
| RISK_INVESTMENTS         | LSARS, HSRA | Health + social risk assessment data to target community investments     | Use HSRA/SDOH evidence to decide what investments matter most (e.g., mobility solutions when access to care is constrained, especially in high-exposure areas). |
| REGULATORY_ALIGNMENT     | LSARS, HSRA | Regulatory-aligned sources and calculations                              | LSARS follows regulatory standards by using aligned data sources and methods (e.g., US EPA and California OEHHA). |
| TRANSPARENT_REPORTS      | LSARS, HSRA | Live, location-aware reports that explain calculations with citations    | Build trust in outputs with inspectable calculations and citation pills so reviewers can validate sources and methods quickly. |
| AGENT_GUARDRAILS         | LSARS, HSRA | Trusted AI agents with anti-hallucination controls and escalation levels | Build trust in answers by routing questions to multiple specialized agents with scoped access to the right data and defined escalation for complex questions. |
