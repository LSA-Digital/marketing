# Asset Pipeline Scripts

Playwright capture scripts for marketing post assets. Each script contains `async (page) => { ... }` functions compatible with Playwright MCP's `browser_run_code`.

## Scripts

| Script | Product | Posts | Assets |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| `lsars-captures.js` | LSARS HRA (localhost:3230) | T-024, T-027, T-029, T-032, T-033, T-039 | Map views, hotspot analysis, chatbot, architecture |
| `medicoda-captures.js` | MEDICODA / HAI-EM (localhost:3000) | T-019, T-020, T-035 | Dashboard, audit logs, mobile queue, wizard |
| `epms-captures.js` | EPMS (localhost:5173) | T-017, T-018, T-021, T-022, T-038 | Kanban, product detail, guest portal, MCP tools |

## Codebase-Derived Assets (no script needed)

Posts T-023, T-025, T-026, T-028, T-030, T-031, T-034, T-036, T-037, T-040, T-041 use:
- **Code snippets** extracted from source repos and formatted as fenced blocks in markdown
- **Mermaid diagrams** written directly in post markdown
- **Markdown tables/checklists** written directly in post markdown

These don't need Playwright scripts — they're generated by reading source files and writing markdown.

## How to Run

Each script exports multiple capture functions. To run one:

```javascript
// Via Playwright MCP browser_run_code:
skill_mcp(mcp_name="playwright", tool_name="browser_run_code", arguments={
  "code": "async (page) => { /* paste function body here */ }"
})
```

Or run the full script to capture all screenshots for a product at once.

## Prerequisites

- All 3 services running (see docs/asset-creation-pipeline.md)
- Asset directories created: `mkdir -p posts/2026/02/<post-folder>/assets`
- For EPMS: auth header set first (see epms-captures.js)

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains reference screenshots from previous runs, showing what "good" output looks like for each capture type.
