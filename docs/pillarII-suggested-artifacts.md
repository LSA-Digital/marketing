## Capture Guidelines

1. **Redact** sensitive data (API keys, internal URLs, customer names) before attaching to posts.
2. **Prefer real screenshots** over mockups. Even rough screenshots of real systems are more credible.
3. **Include context** — a screenshot with a one-line caption is better than a screenshot alone.
4. **Store in post folder** — each artifact goes in the relevant post's `assets/` directory.
5. **Update post** — after capturing, update the post's "Post asset ideas" to check the box and reference the file.
