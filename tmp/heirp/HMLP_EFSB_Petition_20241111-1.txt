Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project  
EFSB Petition

Section 1     
Project Overview 
1.1 Siting Board Jurisdiction 
Pursuant to G.L. c. 164, § 69J, Hingham Municipal L ighting Plant (“HMLP”) submits this 
analysis (“Analysis”) to the Energy Facilities Siti ng Board (“Siting Board” or “EFSB”) in 
support of its petition to construct certain facili ties to ensure the reliability of the 
transmission system serving the Town of Hingham.  
As set forth in HMLP’s Petition to Construct, pursuant to G.L. c. 164, § 69J, HMLP proposes 
to construct, operate, and maintain (1) a proposed approximately 3.2-mile underground 
115 kilovolt (kV) transmission line in the Towns of Weymouth and Hingham (“New Line”); 
and (2) a proposed enclosed substation located at t he transfer station site at Old Hobart 
Street in the Town of Hingham (“New Substation” or “Hobart II”).  HMLP also seeks 
approval of a proposed open-air switching station o r tap station in Weymouth (“New Tap 
Station”), which would be constructed, owned, and operated by NSTAR Electric Company 
d/b/a Eversource Energy (“Eversource”) within an ex isting transmission corridor on land 
owned by Eversource.  (The proposed New Line, New Substation and New Tap Station are 
referred to collectively as the “Project”.)  The Ne w Line, New Substation and New Tap 
Station are each more fully detailed below. 
As required by G.L. c. 164, § 69J, the Project as m ore fully described herein is necessary 
to provide a reliable energy supply for the Commonw ealth while minimizing cost and 
environmental impacts.  Specifically, the Project is needed for reliability purposes because 
the entire Town of Hingham presently is susceptible  to an extended outage in the event 
of N-1 and N-1-1 contingencies.  Moreover, while not needed for capacity purposes in the 
near term, the proposed Project offers the distinct benefit of addressing peak load growth 
associated with electrification necessary to meet t he Town of Hingham’s and 
Commonwealth’s climate goals.    
As described in greater detail herein, the Project components comprise: 
• The New Line, approximately 3.2 miles in length, beginning at the New Substation 
to be sited at the Town of Hingham Transfer Station , continuing underground 
primarily along public ways in the Towns of Hingham  and Weymouth, and 
terminating at a point of interconnection (POI) wit h the New Tap Station located 
within an existing Eversource transmission corridor in Weymouth. 
• The New Substation, which will be located on an approximately 24,000 square feet 
(“sf”) undeveloped area in the northeastern corner of the 9.7-acre Town of 
Hingham Transfer Station off Old Hobart Street and in close proximity to HMLP’s 
existing Hobart Substation.  Structures, equipment,  and site improvements will 
include a new Gas Insulated Switchgear (“GIS”) subs tation, circuit breakers, bus 
work, protection and communications equipment, fenc ing and a retaining wall.  
Although not needed for capacity purposes at this t ime, the New Substation 
footprint is large enough to accommodate the additi on of a new transformer and 
new switch gear when needed. Underground stormwater  management BMPs are

proposed within adjacent driveways, for a total imp act area associated with the 
substation of approximately 31,000 sf. 
• The New Tap Station, an open-air substation including air-insulated switchgear, an 
electrical control enclosure, two electric overhead -to-underground transition 
structures, two 210-foot underground transmission i nterconnections between the 
existing lines and the New Tap Station, one tangent pole, fencing and an additional 
parking area on an approximately 2.5 acre portion of a 11.6-acre Eversource parcel 
off Broad Street in Weymouth. 1 
A USGS map and an Aerial map showing the New Line, New Substation and New Tap 
Station are provided as Figure 1-1 and Figure 1-2, respectively. 
1.2 Hingham Municipal Lighting Plant 
HMLP is a municipal electric light department, one of over 40 such light departments in 
Massachusetts and 2,000 nationwide.  The Town of Hi ngham has a population of 24,284 
(as of 2020), and HMLP currently serves approximately 10,500 electric meters.  HMLP has 
the capacity to serve about 80 MVA peak demand, and  HMLP’s peak load to date was 57 
MVA on August 29, 2018.   
HMLP is governed by a three-member elected municipa l light board.  See  G.L. c. 164, § 
55. Pursuant to G.L. c. 164, § 56, HMLP’s General M anager (“GM”) is appointed by the 
Light Board and, subject to the Board’s direction a nd control, is responsible for the day-
to-day operations of HMLP, the supervision of the p lant, power supplies and employees, 
and ensuring that HMLP is providing reliable electr ic service to all of the residents and 
businesses of the Town of Hingham.    
Unlike investor-owned utilities (“IOUs”), municipal  light departments possess their own 
ratemaking authority.  Their rates are not subject to suspension and investigation by the 
Department of Public Utilities (“DPU”) prior to tak ing effect.  Instead, light department 
rates are largely determined pursuant to a statutory formula, based on a budget prepared 
by the GM and approved by the Light Board.  See  G.L. c. 164, §§ 57, 58.  While municipal 
light departments are financially and operationally distinct from the towns that own them, 
in some areas, such as expanding plant, acquiring p roperty and financing it, municipal 
light departments can only finance significant proj ects through their towns, via the 
bonding process set forth at G.L. c. 44, §8(8), whi ch requires Town Meeting approval.  
See  G.L. c. 164, §§ 34, 40.  Further, title to real pr operty is typically acquired and held 
by the Town, which places it under the custody and control of the light department for 
light department purposes.  See  G.L. c. 40, § 3.  The Supreme Judicial Court has held that 
“[m]unicipal lighting plants are municipal property  and a "debt for plant" is a municipal 
debt.”  Municipal Light Comm’n. of Taunton v. State Employees’ Group Insurance  
  
 
1  Both the New Substation and the New Tap Station a re ancillary facilities to the New 
Line and, therefore, are included within HMLP’s Sec tion 69J Petition for approval.  
Because Eversource will construct, own and operate the Tap Station, Eversource is 
a co-petitioner to the petition for zoning relief filed on this date pursuant to G.L. c. 
40A, § 3.

Comm’n. , 344 Mass. 533, 536 (1962).  Accordingly, as discussed in Section 4 addressing 
the site selection process for the New Substation, unlike an IOU, HMLP is constrained by 
the statutes governing its operations in relation to the Town of Hingham when it comes to 
acquiring sites for new projects. 
1.3 Project Need 
The Project is designed to provide a long-term, integrated solution to address a significant 
reliability need in the Town of Hingham.  As set fo rth in Section 2 herein, HMLP currently 
is served by a single bulk power substation known as “Hobart Substation”.  HMLP’s current 
substation and distribution system is designed to a llow for loss of a single 115/13.8kV 
transformer while still retaining the capability to  serve the highest load demand of the 
Town. 
Hobart Substation is presently fed via two overhead  115kV transmission lines covering a 
distance of approximately 3.3 miles, which are supp orted by wood and metal structures, 
including 22 double-circuit towers (“DCTs”), where the two transmission lines share the 
same single pole.  This configuration is susceptibl e to N-1 contingency events that can 
result in simultaneous loss of service from both tr ansmission lines, i.e ., if even a single 
DCT pole supporting the two lines falls or is other wise disabled, service to Hobart 
Substation would be interrupted and all Hingham cus tomers would be subjected to an 
extended outage.  Moreover, an extended outage also  could occur in the event of a N-1-
1 contingency, i.e ., if one transmission line is out of service for m aintenance and there is 
an outage event on the remaining transmission line.   Unlike larger distribution systems, 
there are no alternative supply options available t o HMLP to restore customers from 
another substation.  Consequently, loss of service to Hobart Substation results in loss of 
service to the entire town.  Indeed, approximately 10,500 HMLP metered-customers, 
which includes approximately 24,000 residents, as w ell as a number of medical facilities, 
schools, municipal offices and public safety buildi ngs, would be without electricity in 
Hingham in the event of either of these N-1 or N-1-1 outage events. 
As discussed in greater detail in Section 2, these N-1 and N-1-1 contingencies are a 
significant and current  reliability concern.  These reliability needs are not dependent on 
load growth 
2 and, as such, should be addressed at once.   
 
2   Because HMLP’s existing Hobart Substation presen tly has the ability to serve 80 
MVA on a firm basis with any single transformer out of service, and HMLP projects 
limited load growth over the next 10 years, the proposed Project is not needed for 
capacity purposes.  However, given the climate chan ge goals of both the Town of 
Hingham and the Commonwealth, HMLP determined that it was reasonable and 
prudent to select a substation site and lay out its  proposed substation to 
accommodate a new transformer and switchgear when load growth warrants these 
additions.  HMLP has estimated the technical potential for system peak winter load 
with full electrification and indeed that projected  winter peak exceeds the current 
system capability.  As such, while not needed for c apacity purposes in the near-
term, the proposed Project offers the distinct bene fit of addressing peak winter 
load over the long term in the high electrification case.

As set forth in greater detail in Section 2.3, below, HMLP seeks to comply with the following 
reliability and planning standards when planning its transmission system: 
• NERC TPL-001-4 Transmission System Planning Performance Requirements; 
• NPCC Regional Reliability Reference Directory # 1, “Design and Operation of the 
Bulk Power System”; 
• ISO-NE Planning Procedure 3, “Reliability Standards for the New England Area 
Pool Transmission Facilities”; and 
• ISO-NE Planning Procedure 5-3, “Guidelines for Conducting and Evaluating 
Proposed Plan Application Analyses.” 
The standards issued by NERC, NPCC and ISO-NE all i nclude evaluation of reliability 
performance under certain contingency events.  Such  standards include assessment of 
the impacts associated with single contingency even ts that result in loss of both circuits 
installed on DCTs (N-1 contingency events, such as loss of a single DCT), as well as loss 
of one circuit followed by loss of a second circuit (N-1-1 contingency events, such as when 
one transmission line is out of service for mainten ance and there is an outage event on 
the remaining transmission line).  HMLP has determi ned that under its current system 
configuration, either of these contingency events could result in loss of service to its entire 
service area for an extended period of time.  Outag es involving loss of both existing 
transmission lines (N-1 DCT events or N-1-1 events) could result in customer interruptions 
lasting anywhere from 8 hours to one week or more.  N-1-1 events due to one line out for 
maintenance or damages to one of these transmission  lines followed by loss of a second 
circuit could result in an outage lasting 8 - 48 ho urs.  Moreover, a fallen transmission 
tower (N-1 DCT event) could result in an outage lasting one week or more depending upon 
the degree of damage to the adjacent towers and ava ilability of replacement equipment.   
These system reliability needs are current and require immediate resolution.  
1.4 Project Alternatives 
As set forth in Section 3 herein, HMLP has comprehensively identified and analyzed a wide 
range of alternatives to address the identified nee d for the Project including: (1) a No-
Build Alternative; (2) transmission alternatives; a nd (3) non-transmission alternatives 
(“NTAs”) such as new generation, energy efficiency,  demand response programs, solar 
and battery storage systems, and distributed generation.   
HMLP eliminated the No-Build Alternative because its current system does not meet NERC, 
NPCC and ISO-NE standards.  Unlike larger utilities , which typically have multiple 
substations within an area and can backstop their c ustomer circuits via distribution tie 
circuits from other substations, HMLP is limited to  one substation.  There are no other 
backstop transmission or distribution options avail able to HMLP, and a single N-1 or N-1-
1 event would interrupt power to the Town for an extended period of time. 
HMLP identified and analyzed seven transmission alt ernatives, and as detailed in Section 
3.3.4, below, after reviewing each alternative with  respect to whether each would meet 
HMLP’s identified reliability need, as well as the reliability, cost and environmental impacts 
of each alternative, HMLP determined that only two alternatives met the identified need 
and were deemed viable – (1) the Project; and (2) a  4.2-mile underground line from 
National Grid’s (NGRID) Abington Station to a new H MLP substation site at the South 

--- PAGE 17 ---
Section 1 Project Overview Tighe&Bond 
 
 
Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project  
EFSB Petition 
 1-7
Hingham Industrial Park. 3  Moreover, after fully analyzing these two alterna tives with 
respect to reliability, environmental and construct ion impacts, and costs -- both 
construction costs and distribution system-related costs -- HMLP concluded that the 
proposed Project was the superior transmission alternative.   
As described in Section 3.3.4 of the Analysis, HMLP  determined that construction and 
operation of the Project, i.e ., the New Line, New Substation and New Tap Station , is the 
best transmission approach to meeting the identifie d need based on a balancing of 
reliability, cost, and environmental impacts.  More over, by virtue of its comprehensive 
analysis of Project alternatives, HMLP determined that (1) its New Line would sectionalize 
Eversource line #478-502 in Weymouth and that a new  tap station would be constructed 
on Eversource-owned property along or in the vicini ty of the Eversource ROW in 
Weymouth; and (2) that a new substation would be co nstructed in Hingham in an area 
near HMLP’s Hobart Substation. 
Finally, as set forth in Section 3.3.5 of the Analysis, HMLP identified and analyzed a range 
of non-transmission alternatives for meeting the id entified need, including (1) 
conservation efforts or interruption of firm and non-firm load; (2) wind resources; and (3) 
solar with batteries, and determined that such non-transmission alternatives (individually 
or in combination) did not meet the identified need or would be prohibitively expensive to 
construct.   
1.5 Preferred Route and Noticed Alternative Route 
As set forth in Section 4 below, HMLP first employe d a comprehensive site selection 
process to select a site for a proposed substation in Hingham and a site for a proposed 
tap station in Weymouth.  Then, once the sites for the Hingham substation and Weymouth 
tap station were chosen, a comprehensive route sele ction process was used to select a 
preferred and noticed alternative routes that would connect the new Hobart II Substation 
in Hingham and new Eversource tap station in Weymou th.  With respect to routes, as 
required by the EFSB, HMLP (1) developed and applie d a reasonable set of criteria to 
identify and evaluate routes in a manner that ensur es that no routes were overlooked or 
eliminated that, on balance, are clearly superior to the proposed route; and (2) identified 
at least two noticed routes with some measure of geographic diversity. 
The Preferred Route for the Project, the Broad Street Route, is an approximately 3.2-mile 
underground route primarily along public ways, that  exits the proposed Hobart II 
Substation at the Hingham transfer station and runs  west on Hobart Street, turns south 
on French Street, then turns west on High Street an d continues west into Weymouth on 
High Street which becomes Broad at Commercial Street.  Broad Street is then followed for 
 
3  This 4.2-mile transmission alternative was design ated as Option 3 and initially 
identified and analyzed by HMLP in 2018.  HMLP late r identified and analyzed a 
5.12-mile variation of this transmission alternativ e (Option 3 Variation) which 
follows roadways to the extent practicable and redu ces impacts within wetlands 
and rare and endangered species habitat.  A detaile d description of Option 3 and 
Option 3 Variation, and how these alternatives were derived, are set out in Section 
3.3.4.3 of this Analysis.

approximately 9,300 feet until ending at the Weymouth Tap Station Site located within an 
existing Eversource transmission corridor. 
The Noticed Alternative Route, the Lake Street Rout e, is an approximately 3.7-mile 
underground route that exits the proposed Hobart II Substation in Hingham and runs west 
on Hobart Street, then turns south on French Street  and turns west on High Street.  The 
Noticed Alternative Route then continues west into Weymouth continuing on High Street 
which becomes Broad Street.  This route then turns south down Water Street, turning 
north on Pleasant Street, and travels west on Lake Street, and northwest on Essex Street, 
which transitions to Spring Street.  The route turns west onto Broad Street and continues 
west on Broad Street to the Weymouth Tap Station si te within an existing Eversource 
transmission corridor.  HMLP is also presenting a Variation of its Noticed Alternative Route 
which follows the same route out of the proposed Hobart II Substation to Broad Street in 
Weymouth.  Then, instead of turning south down Water Street, the variation follows Broad 
Street west and turns south on Shawmut Street and t urns southwest onto Lake Street 
where it continues to follow the Noticed Alternativ e Route to the Weymouth Tap Station 
site.  
1.6 Summary of Project Schedule and Cost 
HMLP developed a project schedule based on estimate s of regulatory review times, 
municipal bidding and procurement requirements, and  industry-based expectations 
regarding equipment delivery and construction perio ds for similar facilities.  Assuming 
timely receipt of all necessary permits and authori zations, construction of the New Line, 
New Substation, and New Tap Station is anticipated to commence in Spring 2027. 
Construction is anticipated to occur over a two-yea r period, with energization of the New 
Line expected in the Spring 2029.  The estimated construction schedule assumes that the 
selected site contractor(s) will simultaneously emp loy several active work zones 
associated with each of the routes, in consultation with the affected municipalities.  
 
HMLP developed project costs for the project which are summarized in Table 1-1.  The 
costs reflect the best information on costs available for this Project at the time of filing.   
The current planning grade estimates are (-25% /+50%).

1.7 Agency and Community Outreach 
HMLP is committed to working with municipal officia ls, local residents, businesses, and 
other interested stakeholders in both Hingham and W eymouth to provide clear, 
transparent, and updated information regarding the Project.  For this Project, in addition 
to its outreach efforts regarding the proposed subs tation in Hingham and the proposed 
underground line in Hingham and Weymouth, HMLP has worked closely with Eversource 
on outreach specifically focused on the proposed tap station off Broad Street in Weymouth.  
In fact, HMLP – both on its own and in collaboratio n with Eversource – has held or 
participated in 32 meetings between December 14, 20 20 and June 4, 2024 with officials, 
residents and businesses in both Hingham and Weymou th to discuss the different 
elements of the Project.  Indeed, more than half of those meetings were scheduled for the 
intended purpose of obtaining feedback from stakeho lders regarding different options for 
siting the proposed substation and proposed tap sta tion and for specific feedback on the 
two identified routes and other route options.  See Section 4.1.5.    
A list of outreach meetings with stakeholders in both Hingham and Weymouth is provided 
as Table 4-1.  More information is provided herein regarding HMLP’s outreach activities, 
including public open houses, meetings with Hingham and Weymouth public officials, and 
the Hingham Electric Infrastructure Reliability Pro ject (“HEIRP”) Project-specific website 
(www.HEIRP.com).  
Hingham Pre-Town Meeting Outreach Meetings 
In order to secure custody and control of a portion of the Town of Hingham transfer station 
property, HMLP needed to propose a warrant article for consideration by Town Meeting to 
authorize the Select Board to transfer custody and control of the proposed Hobart II 
substation site to HMLP. 4  G.L. c. 40, §§ 3, 15A.  Only after being duly authorized by Town 
Meeting may the Select Board transfer custody and c ontrol of a portion of municipally-
owned property held for one municipal purpose ( i.e ., as in this case, for Department of 
Public Works purposes) to another board—in this case, the Hingham Municipal Light Board, 
for another municipal purpose, such as light plant purposes. 
Beginning in December 2020 and continuing through t he Spring of 2022, HMLP held 
multiple meetings with Town of Hingham agency heads , the Hingham Conservation 
Commission, the Hingham Select Board and Hingham Ad visory Committee to receive 
feedback on various substation sites as part of the  process for obtaining Town Meeting 
approval.  On April 30, 2022, Town Meeting voted to  authorize the Town, acting through 
the Select Board, to transfer custody and control o f the parcel of land at the Town’s 
transfer station to HMLP. 
Public Open Houses 
As set out in Table 4-1, HMLP conducted a series of  Open Houses in both Weymouth and 
Hingham to provide residents and businesses with in formation regarding the Project and 
to obtain feedback from all stakeholders regarding two potential routes under 
 
4  HMLP is also required to obtain Town Meeting appr oval to borrow funds for some 
portion of the project.  G.L. c. 44, § 8(8).  HMLP may seek Town Meeting approval 
of borrowing as early as Spring 2025.

consideration by HMLP – the Broad Street Route and the Lake Street Route – as well as 
with respect to the proposed Hingham substation and Weymouth tap station sites.   
HMLP held community meetings by Zoom for Hingham st akeholders to the proposed 
substation site on October 18, 2021 and November 18 , 2021.  Notice for these meetings 
included mailing letters to the stakeholders, specifically to abutters within 300 feet of the 
proposed substation location.  On October 20, 2021,  HMLP sought to further raise public 
awareness by emailing to the Boston Globe and the Patriot Ledger as well as to hyperlocal 
news websites including the Hingham Anchor and Wicked Local a press release announcing 
the launch of a project-specific website at www.HEIRP.com. 
HMLP held in-person Open Houses in Weymouth at the Tufts Public Library in Weymouth 
on August 25, 2022 and September 13, 2022.  On September 28, 2022, HMLP held an in-
person Open House at the Hingham Public Library.  And, on October 12, 2022, HMLP held 
a Zoom Open House for both Hingham and Weymouth residents and stakeholders.   
Notice for these meetings was provided as follows: HMLP mailed notice to abutters within 
300 feet of the preliminary  Preferred and Notice A lternative Routes and within ¼ mile of 
both the substation and tap station sites, emailed to all HMLP customers (for the Hingham 
Open House and Zoom Open House), issued press relea ses to the Boston Globe and the 
Patriot Ledger as well as to hyperlocal news websit es including the Hingham Anchor and 
Wicked Local, and posted on the Hingham Electric Infrastructure Reliability Project “HEIRP” 
website and HMLP’s social media channels.  
On January 25, 2024, January 26, 2024, and March 19, 2024, Eversource – with HMLP in 
attendance - held outreach events in Weymouth in the vicinity of the proposed Weymouth 
Tap Station site.  Two Focused Meetings (January 25
th  and January 26 th ) were held at 
Union Towers in Weymouth and an evening Community O pen House was held at the 
Crossroads Church in Weymouth on March 19, 2024.  T wo weeks prior to these events, 
Eversource’s Project Services team was invited by t he Union Towers facility’s director to 
attend two scheduled coffee hours to create awarene ss and to engage with as many 
diverse residents as possible.  Union Towers was se lected as a meeting location after a 
focus area review and at the suggestion of the dire ctor.  There are over 150 units of 
affordable housing for elderly and people over 50 w ith disabilities, and some of the 
residents are also linguistically isolated.  Two we eks prior to the March 19 th  event, 
Eversource’s Project Services team coordinated a pop-up event at Jimmy’s Diner on Broad 
Street, Weymouth, to create awareness for the sched uled Community Open House.  The 
team engaged with local diners during the busy brea kfast/lunch hours at this popular 
eatery, answering questions about the proposed proj ect and handing out invitations.  
Project Services also completed door-to-door outreach to nearby residents and businesses 
and brought the invitations to nearby community gathering spaces (churches, restaurants, 
libraries, housing authority, etc.) to encourage them to post it in advance.  The invitation 
was also mailed to over 3,500 Weymouth residents along the proposed route and sent to 
local elected officials.  A Cantonese interpreter w as utilized at the January 25, 2024 
Focused Meeting and both Spanish and Portuguese int erpreters were present for the 
Community Open House on March 19, 2024.  Project information handouts were available 
in English, Portuguese, Traditional Chinese and Spa nish.  The event was also promoted 
on the www.HEIRP.com website and HMLP’s social media channels.

Meetings with Hingham Officials /Planning Board and  Zoning Board Informal 
Process  
In addition to the meetings held with Hingham offic ials from December 2020 through 
Spring 2022 to address HMLP’s proposed substation s ite in anticipation of Town Meeting, 
HMLP held two meetings on February 15, 2023 and September 12, 2023 – a meeting with 
the Town’s Planning Director and a follow-up meetin g with the Town’s Planning Director, 
the Town Manager and a member of the Select Board - to discuss HMLP’s plans to seek a 
zoning exemption from the DPU/EFSB with respect to its proposed New Substation at the 
Town’s transfer station site.  As a result of these  meetings, HMLP agreed to submit its 
plans for the substation to the Hingham Planning Bo ard and Hingham Zoning Board of 
Appeals for informal review with the goal of provid ing the Siting Board with any 
recommendations and conditions issued by those Boards with respect to the substation.  
On April 12, 2024, HMLP submitted design informatio n on its proposed substation to the 
Hingham Planning Board and Zoning Board of Appeals as part of this informal review 
process.  The Boards subsequently scheduled a joint  public meeting on the proposal for 
June 4, 2024.  The Boards published notice of the meeting in the Hingham Journal on May 
16, 2024 and May 23, 2024, and provided notice to abutters within 300 feet of the transfer 
station property.   In addition, HMLP advised customers of the June 4, 2024 meeting (via 
letter and bill insert) and posted information regarding the meeting on its HEIRP website.  
HMLP also issued a press release regarding the Proj ect and the joint public meeting 
scheduled for June 4 th , which was published in the Hingham Anchor on May 20, 2024.  Due 
to a typographical error, a portion of the Zoom mee ting ID was inadvertently left off the 
HMLP mailer and the GM Update on the HEIRP website.   The correct information was 
published in the newspapers, on a press release uploaded to the HEIRP website, the Town 
of Hingham’s website and abutters mailings.  HMLP h as posted a video recording of the 
June 4, 2024 meeting on its HEIRP website.   
The June 4, 2024 meeting included approximately 38 attendees including Board members 
and members of the public, who were invited to make comments and ask questions.  The 
Boards reviewed the project, indicated no oppositio n to the proposed substation, and 
voted to recommend conditions for the Select Board to consider in connection with their 
transfer of the custody and control of the Substati on parcel to HMLP.  The Boards’ 
recommendations are provided as Appendix 1-1 herein  and are included as Exhibit G in 
the joint zoning exemption petition submitted by HMLP and Eversource.  HMLP intends to 
comply with the Boards’ recommended conditions. 
As is the case with Weymouth, outreach with Hingham  regarding the Project is ongoing 
and will continue through permitting and construction. 
Meetings with Weymouth Officials 
Between April 6, 2021 and March 12, 2024, HMLP held  10 meetings with Weymouth 
officials, including the Mayor and his staff, the W eymouth Planning Director, the 
Weymouth Conservation Commission, the Weymouth Depa rtment of Public Works, and 
various members of the Town Council.   
HMLP’s May 3, 2022 meeting with the Weymouth Conservation Commission also included 
representatives from the Fore River Watershed Assoc iation and the Town’s Herring 
Warden. 

--- PAGE 22 ---

EFSB Petition 
 1-12 
At these meetings, HMLP discussed and obtained feedback regarding its identified routes, 
timing of construction and potential impact on othe r Weymouth projects, construction 
methods, and, in the case of the May 3, 2022 meeting, impacts on the Town’s herring run.  
In discussions with Town officials and corresponden ce with the Planning Director, HMLP 
discussed the need to petition the DPU/EFSB for a z oning exemption for the tap station. 
Weymouth officials expressed no opposition to or op inion on the plans of HMLP and 
Eversource to seek zoning relief pursuant to G.L. c. 40A, § 3. 
As is the case with Hingham, outreach with Weymouth  regarding the Project is ongoing 
and will continue through permitting and construction. 
HEIRP Website/Project Updates 
HMLP maintains an HEIRP website with updated inform ation and materials regarding the 
Project.  Among other things, the HEIRP website includes information on the need for the 
Project; maps and details regarding the proposed and alternative transmission line routes 
for the project, the proposed Hingham substation si te and the proposed Eversource tap 
station site in Weymouth; details regarding the out reach and regulatory and permitting 
processes for the Project; and Q & A regarding the Project.   
HMLP also has issued three GM Updates regarding the  Project – in March 2023, March 
2024 and May 2024.  These GM Updates, which are des igned to provide the latest 
information regarding the Project and identify upcoming events, are mailed or emailed to 
all HMLP customers, and uploaded to the HEIRP website.  
The HEIRP website also offers residents and busines ses in Hingham and Weymouth an 
opportunity to provide feedback regarding the Project. 
Going forward, HMLP plans to employ the HEIRP websi te as a means of providing 
information regarding all state and local permittin g, including notices of public hearings, 
and as a repository for all regulatory filings and information.  Ultimately, HMLP expects 
that the HEIRP website will include all constructio n-related information, including hotline 
numbers for questions and registering concerns, and operate as a central access point for 
all Hingham and Weymouth residents and businesses t o obtain the latest information on 
the Project.

1.9 Conclusion 
HMLP proposes to construct and operate a 3.2-mile underground 115kV transmission line 
in public ways in the Towns of Hingham and Weymouth  and a New Substation at the 
transfer station property adjacent to its existing Hobart Substation in Hingham.  In 
addition, as part of this Project, Eversource would construct, own and operate a New Tap 
Station within an existing Eversource transmission corridor in Weymouth.  
As detailed in this Analysis, together these three elements comprise HMLP’s proposed 
Project which will meet a current reliability need for HMLP.  And, while the proposed Project 
is not needed for capacity purposes in the near ter m, the site for the New Substation 
selected by HMLP is large enough to accommodate a new transformer and new switchgear 
and, as such, offers the distinct benefit of addressing peak winter load over the long term 
in the high electrification case.   
Like all utilities, HMLP has an obligation to relia bly serve its customers.  HMLP can only 
meet this obligation through construction and opera tion of the Project.  For the reasons

described in greater detail in the subsequent sections of this Analysis, the proposed Project 
is consistent with the Siting Board’s statute and s atisfies all Siting Board standards 
regarding need, project alternatives, site and rout e selection, and minimization of 
environmental impacts and costs under G.L. c. 164, § 69J, and therefore, should be 
approved by the Siting Board.

HMLP, a municipally owned electric utility, provide s electricity to approximately 10,500 
HMLP metered-customers, which includes approximatel y 24,000 residents, as well as a 
number of medical facilities, schools, municipal of fices and public safety buildings within 
the Town of Hingham, Massachusetts. 
HMLP is served by a single bulk power substation kn own as “Hobart Substation”, located 
at 190 Old Hobart Street in Hingham, adjacent to th e Town landfill and recycle center.  
HMLP’s current substation and distribution system is designed to allow for loss of a single 
115/13.8kV transformer while still retaining the ca pability to serve the highest load 
demand of the Town. 
Hobart Substation currently is fed via two overhead  115kV transmission lines covering a 
distance of approximately 3.3 miles, which are supp orted by both wood and metal 
structures, including 22 DCTs, where the two transm ission lines share the same single 
pole.  This configuration is susceptible to conting ency events that can result in 
simultaneous loss of service from both transmission  lines interrupting service to Hobart 
Substation.  Likewise, if even a single DCT pole su pporting the two lines falls or is 
otherwise disabled, service to Hobart Substation wo uld be interrupted and all customers 
within the town of Hingham would be subjected to an  extended outage. A fallen 
transmission tower could result in an outage lastin g a week or more depending on the 
degree of damage to the adjacent towers and availab ility of replacement equipment.  An 
interruption of service to all Hingham customers la sting from 8 hours to 48 hours could 
also occur if one transmission line is out of servi ce for maintenance or as a result of a 
single circuit outage event and there is an outage event on the remaining transmission 
line. Unlike larger utilities, there are no alterna tive supply options available to HMLP to 
restore customers from another substation. Conseque ntly, loss of service to Hobart 
substation results in loss of service to the entire town. 
Based on the conditions noted above, HMLP has concl uded that, due to the reliability of 
service concerns identified, there is an existing n eed to mitigate the potential for loss of 
service to the town of Hingham, MA. 
2.2 Description of the Existing Transmission System  
Supply 
Hobart Substation receives 115kV supply from the New England Transmission System and 
steps the voltage down via three 24/32/40 MVA power  transformers and feeds the town 
through its 13.8 kV electric distribution system.  The existing Hobart Substation presently 
has the ability to serve 80 MVA on a firm basis wit h any single transformer out of service 
using the 55 degree C rating of the remaining transformers.  Existing annual peak demand 
load for the town is approximately 57 MVA, and pres ently load growth is projected to be 
limited.

Hobart Substation occupies approximately 20,000 squ are feet (slightly less than a half-
acre).  The site is located adjacent to Old Hobart Street on one side, and on all other sides 
by access and exit drives to the Town of Hingham Transfer Station. The existing substation 
is an open air design.  Within the substation footp rint there are transmission termination 
structures and switches that feed a 115kV cross bus  to allow connections to three (3) 
transformers which step the power down from 115kV t o 13.8kV.  The 13.8kV power 
provides distribution to the Town via 13.8 kV switchgear and distribution circuits that exit 
the substation underground.  Design of the existing  station has leveraged the space very 
effectively; however, there is limited space availa ble within the fence line for additional 
structures.  HMLP has evaluated expansion of the su bstation in its existing location and 
has determined that to expand the substation contig uously would require encroachment 
into the existing transfer station access roads or trash loading areas.  Moreover, this 
expansion approach was not acceptable to the Public  Works Department, and the Town 
Select Board.  These restrictions drove HMLP’s prop osal to locate any new equipment 
separate and apart from the existing substation footprint.   
Hobart Substation is presently interconnected to two Eversource 115kV transmission lines 
(Line numbers 478-503 and 478-508) which are part o f the New England Transmission 
System.  These two lines serving Hobart Substation originate from a tap located in 
Weymouth on the Eversource 115kV transmission lines  that run between Edgar Station 
and Holbrook Substation.  
The initial 2.3-mile section of the two 115kV lines  presently serving Hobart Substation 
begins at the Eversource tap point on the Eversource ROW (for circuits 478-503 and 478-
508), runs along the Greenbush rail line, and terminates at the East Weymouth Substation 
on North Wharf Street in Weymouth.  This 2.3-mile s ection and the East Weymouth 
Substation are owned and maintained by NGRID.   This initial 2.3-mile section is a mix of 
(23) separate monopoles and seven (7) DCTs. 
HMLP owns and maintains the transmission lines alon g the second section of the two 
115kV lines from East Weymouth Substation to Hobart Substation, a distance of 1.1 miles.  
This second section of the two lines comprises a to tal of 19 structures, 15 of which are 
DCTs.  In total, HMLP owns and maintains a mix of b oth metal towers and wood towers, 
including a mix of metal DCTs and wood DCTs.  The HMLP-owned portion of the two lines 
run adjacent to the active Greenbush rail line and then travels along local Hingham 
roadways to get to Hobart Substation. 
5 
Although the current transmission supply has adequa te single line outage (N-1 
contingency event) capacity, as noted above, the tr ansmission lines are on the same 
structures for a distance of over a mile from NGRID’s East Weymouth substation to Hobart 
Street as well as on portions of the NGRID-owned li nes from the Eversource tap to East 
Weymouth. This configuration is susceptible to DCT failure outage events (N-1 
contingency event) that can result in simultaneous loss of service for both transmission 
lines causing an extended outage which could last a nywhere from 8 hours to a week or 
more for the entire Town of Hingham.  An outage las ting from 8 hours up to 48 hours 
could also occur if one transmission line is out of  service (due to maintenance or a single 
 
5  The 1.1-mile portion of the line from East Weymou th Substation to Hobart 
Substation was approved by the Energy Facilities Siting Council, predecessor to the 
EFSB, in 1986.  See  EFSC Docket 85-65, 14 DOMSC 7 (1976).

line contingency) and there is an event on the rema ining transmission line (N-1-1 
contingency event).  In such an outage event, appro ximately 10,500 HMLP metered-
customers, which includes approximately 24,000 residents, as well as a number of medical 
facilities, schools, municipal offices and public s afety buildings, would be without power 
for an extended period of time. 
Figure 2-1 is a one-line diagram showing the interc onnection of the existing Hobart 
Substation to the 115kV circuit numbers 478-503 and 478-508 which are part of the New 
England Transmission System. The loss of both interconnecting circuits due to a single (N-
1) DCT contingency or due to overlapping (N-1-1) co ntingencies completely isolates the 
substation from the rest of the transmission system . This would leave Hobart Substation 
out of service and cut off electric power supply to the entire Town of Hingham.

Finally, where the existing Hobart Substation presently has the ability to serve 80 MVA on 
a firm basis with any single transformer out of ser vice, and HMLP projects limited load 
growth over the next 10 years, the proposed Project  is not currently needed for capacity 
purposes.  However, given the climate change goals of both the Town of Hingham and the 
Commonwealth, HMLP determined that it was reasonabl e and prudent to select a 
substation site and lay out its proposed substation  to accommodate a new transformer 
and switchgear when load warrants these additions.  HMLP has estimated the technical 
potential for system peak winter load with full electrification and that winter peak exceeds 
the current system capability.  As such, while not needed for capacity purposes in the 
near-term, the proposed Project offers the distinct benefit of addressing peak winter load 
over the long term in the high electrification case.

2.3 Methodology for Analyzing System Reliability 
HMLP provides electric supply to the Town of Hingham as a municipal electric supplier and 
has determined it is appropriate to follow national  and regional reliability criteria. While 
HMLP does not operate Bulk Electric System 6 facilities or Pool Transmission Facilities 7, it 
does, as a Load Serving Entity and Transmission Ope rator as defined by NERC 8, follow 
good utility practice and on this basis appropriate ly considers national and regional 
reliability standards as establishing a sound basis for assessing its system with respect to 
the reliability and adequacy of the system it maint ains and operates. While HMLP is not 
required under any state or federal regulation to f ollow these standards, HMLP has 
determined that it is appropriate to assess its sys tem reliability performance based on 
these standards as part of its efforts to provide i ts customers with the same level of 
reliability as other customers across the state.  M ore specifically, HMLP strives to adhere 
to the reliability standards and criteria that are established under the oversight of NERC, 
which is charged with ensuring the reliability of transmission systems across most of North 
America. NERC oversees a number of regional councils, one of which is the NPCC, covering 
New York, New England and eastern Canada. NPCC has a number of “control areas” which 
includes the New England transmission system that i s under the control of ISO New 
England (ISO-NE). ISO-NE operates the various transmission networks owned by electric 
utilities in New England as a single transmission s ystem. The standards established by 
NERC, NPCC and ISO-NE have been developed to ensure  that the electric power system 
serving New England, which includes HMLP, is design ed and constructed to provide 
adequate and reliable electric power to customers.  NERC establishes a general set of rules 
and criteria applicable to all geographic areas.  NPCC establishes a set of rules and criteria 
that are particular to the northeast, and also enco mpass the more general NERC 
standards.  In turn, ISO-NE develops standards and criteria that are specific to New 
England, but are also coordinated with NPCC.  HMLP seeks to comply with the following 
reliability and planning standards when planning its transmission system: 
• NERC TPL-001-4 Transmission System Planning Performance Requirements; 
• NPCC Regional Reliability Reference Directory #1, “Design and Operation of the 
Bulk Power System”; 
• ISO-NE Planning Procedure 3, “Reliability Standards for the New England Area 
“Pool Transmission Facilities”; and   
• ISO-NE Planning Procedure 5-3, “Guidelines for Conducting and Evaluating 
Proposed Plan Application Analyses.” 
These standards all include evaluation of reliability performance under certain contingency 
events. These standards include assessment of the i mpacts associated with single 
contingency events that result in loss of both circ uits installed on DCTs (N-1 contingency 
events) as well as loss of one circuit followed by loss of a second circuit (N-1-1 contingency 
 
6  Bulk Electric System facilities are defined by NE RC as networked facilities operating 
at 100 kV or greater that have the potential for regional impacts. 
7  Pool Transmission Facilities are defined by ISO-N E as regional networked facilities 
operating at 69 kV or higher that integrate the New England transmission systems.

events). As set forth below, HMLP has determined that either of these contingency events 
could result in loss of service to its entire service area. 
2.4 Consistency with Transmission Standards 
The reliability standards referenced in Section 2.3  above all call for consideration of such 
contingency events when evaluating the reliability of service of the transmission system. 
The configuration of the transmission facilities connected to HMLP are not considered Pool 
Transmission Facilities as they are radial in natur e and are not an integral part of the 
interconnected transmission network serving New Eng land.  As such, there are no other 
transmission network facilities to rely upon to help address any such outage events.   
HMLP has encountered a number of events in the past that either resulted in a Town-wide 
power outage or put the Town of Hingham at risk of interrupting all customers.  A 
significant past outage event occurred in 1991 invo lving a failed insulator which resulted 
in tripping of both transmission circuits supplying  Hobart substation interrupting service 
to the entire town for 24 hours.  Another outage ev ent lasting over 8 hours which placed 
the HMLP system at risk occurred during a severe we ather event in December of 2017 
which was the result of damage to portions of one o f the two transmission lines serving 
HMLP and caused repairs to be needed during severe cold weather conditions. Also, as 
recently as 2022 one of the two transmission circui ts supplying Hingham (circuit number 
478-508) experienced an insulator failure which int errupted service from this line and 
required almost 24 hours to repair.  Fortunately, i nterruption of service to Hingham 
customers served by this circuit was less than 15 m inutes as loads were able to be 
transferred to an alternate transformer following the outage.   
Given the past experience with such events, the radial nature of the existing transmission 
lines, as well as assessments enumerated in the abo ve-referenced reliability standards, 
HMLP has concluded that additional energy resources are needed to maintain reliability of 
service for the Town of Hingham. 
2.5 Summary of Project Need 
The existing transmission configuration is suscepti ble to a number of N-1 and N-1-1 
contingency events that can result in an extended outage to the entire Town of Hingham.  
An N-1 contingency event involving a fallen transmi ssion tower could result in an outage 
lasting one week or more depending on the degree of damage to the adjacent towers and 
availability of replacement equipment.  An extended  outage could also occur for a N-1-1 
contingency, i.e., if one transmission line is out of service for maintenance or as a result 
of a single line outage and there was an event on the remaining transmission line.  HMLP 
has concluded that the impact of these potential contingency events as enumerated in the 
reliability standards referenced above is not consi stent with these standards and is 
unacceptable from a reliability of service perspective.  HMLP has reviewed several potential 
solutions to address this need and Section 3 of thi s filing describes HMLP’s process for 
reviewing potential solutions and the preferred solution that has been identified and is the 
subject of these proceedings.

Section 3     
Project Alternatives 
3.1 Introduction 
In this section, HMLP describes the process it used  to identify and evaluate a range of 
alternatives to address the reliability need identified in Section 2.  As discussed in Section 
2, a solution is needed to comprehensively address N-1 contingency events, i.e. , loss of 
both circuits installed on DCTs, and N-1-1 continge ncy events, i.e. , loss of one circuit 
followed by an additional contingency event involvi ng a circuit, a generator, or a 
transformer. 
Consistent with Siting Board precedent, 
9 HMLP has identified and analyzed a number of 
potential project alternatives from the perspective  of their ability to reliably meet the 
identified need with a minimum impact on the enviro nment and at the lowest possible 
cost.  Specifically, HMLP considered the following alternatives:  
(1)  a “No-Build” alternative;  
(2)  Transmission (or wires) alternatives; and  
(3)  Non-transmission alternatives (“NTAs”), including n ew renewable generation, 
energy efficiency (“EE”) and energy storage technol ogies, either alone or in 
combination with renewable resources. 
3.2 No-Build Alternative 
Under the No-Action or “No Build” Alternative, HMLP would not construct any new facilities 
to address the reliability need identified in Secti on 2.  The current transmission system 
serving HMLP would remain unchanged. 
As discussed in Section 2, additional energy resour ces are needed here because HMLP 
seeks to operate its system consistent with certain  transmission and reliability standards 
issued by NERC, NPCC and ISO-NE.
10   Specifically, with respect to HMLP’s existing system, 
a failure of both supply circuits on a single DCT can leave all customers in Hingham without 
power.  This is an unacceptable condition as any ou tage length for an event of this type 
could easily be 8 to 48 hours before at least one of the DCT circuits is restored and in the 
case of a fallen DCT structure, could take a week o r more to restore power to the HMLP 
 
9    The Siting Board requires a petitioner to show that, on balance, its proposed project 
is superior to such alternative approaches in terms of cost, environmental impact, 
and ability to meet the identified need.  In additi on, the Siting Board requires a 
petitioner to consider reliability of supply as par t of its showing that the proposed 
project is superior to alternative project approaches.  New England Power Company

system.  Unlike large investor-owned utilities, whi ch typically have multiple substations 
within an area and can backstop their customer circ uits via distribution tie circuits from 
other substations, HMLP is limited to one substatio n.  There are no other backstop 
transmission or distribution options available to HMLP, and a single DCT N-1 event would 
interrupt power to the Town for an extended period of time (anywhere from 8 hours to a 
week or more depending upon the severity of the eve nt) due to the lack of switching 
alternatives.  As such, there are no temporary meas ures or solutions available to HMLP 
which could defer this reliability need.  Similarly , an outage event or maintenance 
requirement that takes one of the two circuits supp lying HMLP out of service for an 
extended duration (anywhere from 8 to 48 hours) cou ld result in loss of service to the 
entire town if the second remaining transmission line were to experience an outage event 
(i.e ., an N-1-1 contingency).  And, again, no backstop transmission or distribution options 
are available to HMLP which would prevent the ident ified N-1-1 events from interrupting 
power to the Town for an extended period of time. 
HMLP thus eliminated the No-Build Alternative becau se it would not provide a solution to 
the identified, existing transmission reliability needs of the Town of Hingham. 
3.3 Transmission Alternatives 
3.3.1 Assessment Factors for Transmission Alternatives 
The process for identification of a transmission so lution started with development of 
conceptual solutions, followed by high-level assess ments of those solutions for suitability 
and satisfactorily addressing the identified need, followed by detailed design assessments 
of the remaining viable alternatives.  HMLP evaluat ed a range of possible transmission 
alternatives based on their ability to meet the ide ntified need as established in Section 2 
of the Petition, and more specifically, the ability  to continue to serve customers in the 
Town of Hingham upon loss of both existing circuits  to the Town.  As a basis of design, 
HMLP’s baseline requirements for transmission alternatives are as follows: 
• The transmission alternative should have the capacity to operate and serve the 
existing firm load capability of the Town (approximately 80 MVA 11 ). 
• The transmission alternative should be able to be implemented in a manner to 
operate within industry and regulatory guidelines a nd requirements to serve 
the Town. 
• The transmission alternative should mitigate N-1 DC T contingency events as 
well as N-1-1 contingency events. 
• Any transmission alternative should be able to serv e the load capacities of the 
Town for 8 to 48 hours at a minimum, and the preferred solution should be able 
to be operated over the full duration of time while  repairs, modifications, or 
restrictions on the use of the existing transmission lines are completed. 
• A transmission alternative should be able to be eva luated utilizing standard 
project alternative metrics such as cost, reliability, and environmental impact.   
 
11   The existing firm load capability for the HMLP sy stem is 80 MVA as established by 
the existing bulk stepdown transformer’s emergency ratings.  The HMLP system 
peak load of 57 MVA occurred on August 29, 2018.

3.3.2 Assessment of Transmission Alternatives 
As part of its analysis of transmission alternative s, HMLP considered different technical 
designs.  New overhead transmission line alternatives were concluded to not be viable as 
there are no existing transmission line ROWs within the Town of Hingham.  Consequently, 
HMLP limited its analysis primarily to underground alternatives. 12    
The 115kV underground transmission line would be installed in a conduit and cable system 
with three conduits.  Each conduit would contain a single phase conductor.  The conductor 
is proposed to be an XLPE type cable with a 750 kcm il copper conductor.  The rating of 
the new cable is expected to be approximately 100 MVA.   
3.3.3 Identification of Tap Locations (or Points of  Interconnection 
(POIs)) for Transmission Alternatives 
HMLP sought to identify locations within the area t ransmission system to create an 
additional tap point (for a third line) to Hingham.13   HMLP determined that other than the 
existing lines serving Hingham, there are no other transmission lines within the Town of 
Hingham boundaries that could serve as an additional tap point.  This led to the conclusion 
that an additional tap point would need to be located in an adjacent town or area close to 
the Town of Hingham. 
HMLP identified lines owned by Eversource that are north of Hingham that run between 
Edgar Station in Weymouth to a substation in Holbrook (line numbers 478-502, 478-503, 
478-508 and 478-509) which could be considered for possible tap points.  Additionally, 
HMLP identified transmission lines to the south of Hingham owned by NGRID that are 
located in Whitman, Abington, Rockland, Hanover, Norwell, and Scituate (C3 and S9 lines) 
with a spur to North Abington (C3-99 line) that could serve as potential tap points.   
3.3.4 Transmission Alternatives 14  Considered   
Using the assessment factors and design criteria de scribed above, HMLP considered the 
following transmission alternatives to meet the identified need: 
 
12   As detailed in Section 3.3.4.4, below, for one tr ansmission alternative considered 
by HMLP (Option 4), a portion of the line would be overhead within an existing 
transmission ROW and another portion would be underground, and, as set forth in 
Section 3.3.4.6, for a second transmission alternat ive considered by HMLP, the 
replacement of the DCTs with single monopoles for e ach portion of the existing 
circuit where there are presently DCTs (Option 6A),  poles for a separated overhead 
line would be placed within or adjacent to a transmission ROW. 
13   As set forth in Sections 3.3.4.6 and 3.3.4.7 belo w, HMLP considered two 
transmission alternatives that did not involve new tap locations – (1) the 
replacement of the DCTs with single monopoles for e ach portion of the existing 
circuit where there are presently DCTs (Option 6A),  and (2) placement of one of 
the existing transmission lines underground to elim inate the DCT contingency 
(Option 6B).  
14   No distribution alternatives were considered as a  means to address the identified 
need.  As noted herein, there is only one substatio n in Hingham.  Unlike large 
investor-owned utilities which often operate multip le substations in an area - and

3.3.4.1 Underground Transmission Line from Edgar St ation to Hingham 
Shipyard (Option 1)   
This transmission alternative (Option 1) involves t he installation of a new 115kV breaker 
and associated equipment at Eversource’s Edgar Stat ion in order to interconnect to the 
station’s 115kV bus, the construction of a new substation at the Hingham Shipyard in the 
Town of Hingham, and an approximately 2.5-mile underground line between Edgar Station 
and the new substation at the Hingham Shipyard.  Al though a formal request to 
interconnect was not filed with Eversource, availab le information indicates that Edgar 
Station could accommodate this option, although an expansion of the Edgar Station 115kV 
bus configuration would be needed, which likely would be costly.    
A geographic diagram of this project alternative (Option 1) is provided in Figure 3-2. 
The underground corridor for this option would be a long Route 3A, which is a major 
transportation corridor.  The line would cross the Weymouth Back River, which is 
designated as an Outstanding Resource Water (ORW) a nd Area of Critical Environmental 
Concern (ACEC) south of the Route 3A bridge crossin g and has protected open space on 
either side of the river: Abigail Adams State Park and Great Esker Park to the west and 
Back River Wildlife Sanctuary and Reservation to th e east.  If trenchless technology is 
required to cross the river, the construction may i mpact designated ORW, ACEC, or 
protected open space.  Moreover, there is currently  not an available municipal parcel in 
the vicinity of the Hingham Shipyard to site a new electric substation.  Land is at a 
premium in this location, and it would be difficult  to acquire private property 15  large 
enough for a new substation and related equipment, not to mention sufficient land to 
accommodate a transformer at a later date.   
Moreover, the work necessary to integrate this tran smission alternative with the existing 
distribution system would likely be significant as there are only two feeders in the area of 
Hingham Shipyard with limited street routes to conn ect to other feeders.  Considerable 
feeder work would be required to extend remote circuits to this location if it is to serve as 
a back up to Hobart Substation.  The additional wor k needed to integrate with the 
distribution system would increase the costs of this option significantly.  
In sum, this alternative was deemed not to be a via ble alternative because of (1) the 
extensive feeder work which would be necessary to i ntegrate a new substation at the 
Hingham Shipyard with HMLP’s distribution system; ( 2) the lack of available land at the 
Hingham Shipyard; (3) the considerable difficulties  associated with construction along 
heavily-travelled Route 3A; and (4) potential impac ts to protected open space or 
designated ORW/ACEC.  Consequently, this alternativ e was eliminated from further 
consideration.  
  
 
15    With no municipal land available in the vicinity  of the Hingham Shipyard, HMLP 
would need the Town to purchase private property on  its behalf, which would add 
considerable time, cost and complexity to this opti on relative to HMLP’s preferred 
alternative.

3.3.4.2 Underground Transmission Line from POI on E versource Circuit 478-
502 in Weymouth to Location Near Existing Hobart Substation in 
Hingham (the Proposed Project) (Option 2) (Proposed  Project) 
This transmission alternative (Option 2), which ult imately was selected by HMLP as its 
proposed project, involves bifurcation of Eversource’s 478-502 in Weymouth, a new 115kV 
tap station to be owned and operated by Eversource, a new substation in Hingham in close 
proximity to the existing Hobart Substation, and an  approximately 3.2-mile underground 
115kV line between the two new stations. 
The new substation is proposed to be built adjacent to the existing Hobart Substation. The 
work at the proposed Hobart II substation would include breakers and/or motor-operated 
switches, and a control house to allow for the ability to sectionalize the 115kV feeders into 
Hobart and feed the existing Hobart Substation via one of the existing lines from 
Weymouth and the new transmission line extension co ming from Weymouth.  One of the 
existing 115kV feeds from Weymouth would serve as a reserve or a standby feed to back 
up the existing and new transmission lines which follow separate routes. 
A geographic facility layout and one line diagram of this project alternative (Option 2) are 
provided in Figure 3-3 and Figure 3-4. 
HMLP requested an analysis from Eversource regarding the reliability and cost impacts of 
HMLP tapping existing transmission circuits 478-502  and 478-509 lines between Edgar 
Station in Weymouth and Holbrook Station.  The resu lts from the Eversource study 
indicated that a new 115kV interconnection to the 4 78-502 and 478-509 transmission 
supply circuits caused no adverse impacts and would require no reconductoring or uprating 
costs upstream of the POI.  Following issuance of t he Eversource study, HMLP requested 
that Eversource utilize a connection to the 478-502  line only, and sectionalize that line 
creating two line segments. HMLP and Eversource agr eed to pursue that option.  This 
proposed design for modification of the New England  transmission system ( i.e ., 
sectionalizing the 478-502 circuit) was reviewed an d approved by ISO-NE on August 21, 
2023 as part of their “Proposed Plan Application” (PPA) process.

The estimated cost for Option 2 is $104.7 Million 16  (See TABLE 3-1 below).  These costs 
include construction of 3.25 miles of new solid dielectric 115kV cable in a duct bank along 
a new path as well as various 115kV breakers and sw itches at the new Eversource tap 
station in Weymouth, and a new substation adjacent to Hobart Station in Hingham.  
TABLE 3-1 Estimated Cost of Option 2 (Preferred Solution) 
OPTION 2 ELEMENTS  COST ESTIMATE 
Tap station (based on Eversource costs)  $38.1 M 
Eversource Transmission upgrades $0 
Hingham Transmission line  $47.7 M 
Hobart 2 GIS station and interties  $18.9 M 
Total Estimated 2024 Cost for Option 2 $104.7 M 
 
From an environmental perspective, the location of the tap station is within an existing 
Eversource transmission corridor, set back from Bro ad Street and residential uses, and 
sited to minimize potential impacts to wetland reso urce areas and their associated buffer 
zones.   The proposed Hobart II substation would be located within the Hingham Transfer 
Station property and is set back from residential p roperties.  The transmission line would 
cross Herring Run Brook in Weymouth, within the Bro ad Street roadway ROW.  Three 
smaller culvert crossings of unnamed hydrologic con nections/streams are also along this 
route.  The impacts associated with these crossings  can be appropriately mitigated at a 
reasonable cost.  Although the line would cross the designed ORW/ACEC for the Weymouth 
Back River, crossings would occur within previously  disturbed road ROW.  Further, this 
option avoids impacts to protected open space.   
With respect to reliability, this option meets HMLP ’s reliability needs and also allows for 
the future expansion of the new substation to include an additional transformer to provide 
the ability to add distribution capacity as well as  provide back up for the existing Hobart 
Street substation.  Moreover, because the proposed Hobart II substation would be located 
in close proximity to the existing Hobart Station, compared to other transmission 
alternatives, the cost and complexity of integratin g this option with HMLP’s distribution 
system would be considerably less. 
As discussed further in Section 3.3.4.8 below, HMLP  selected this alternative as its 
proposed project because, on balance, it was preferable to other alternatives with respect 
to meeting the identified need, cost, and environmental impacts.  Moreover, with respect 
to reliability, this alternative raises far less co mplex system integration issues when 
compared to other options.   
 
16    Although the transmission alternatives discussed  in this section were analyzed by 
HMLP in 2018, the costs presented in this section for all alternatives are 2024 costs.

3.3.4.3 Underground Transmission Line from NGRID’s North Abington 
Substation to South Hingham Industrial Park (Option 3) 
This transmission alternative (Option 3) would tap into NGRID’s 115kV C3-99 overhead 
line at the North Abington substation in Abington.  The transmission line associated with 
this option would be a 4.2-mile underground line ex tending from North Abington 
Substation, through the former Weymouth naval air station to a new HMLP substation site 
at the South Hingham Industrial Park. 17   
A geographic diagram and one line diagram of this project alternative (Option 3 and Option 
3 Variation) is provided in Figure 3-5 and Figure 3-6 respectively. 
NGRID’s 115kV C3-99 line is a tap line from the 115 kV C3 Line, which is a radial line 
supplied from the Auburn Street Substation #451 in Whitman.  The C3 Line essentially 
parallels NGRID’s S9 line, and the two lines supply several load serving substations in the 
South Shore area, including the North Abington substation #99, as well as substations at 
Plymouth Street #93 in Abington, Philips Lane #95 and Water Street #910 substations in 
Hanover, and Norwell substation #96 in Norwell.  In the event of loss of either of the two 
lines, all of the load that is served by both lines would be picked up by the remaining line, 
either automatically or by way of post-contingency operator switching. 
This transmission option would also require modifications to the North Abington substation 
#99 to accommodate the line extension.  In addition  to bus extensions and circuit 
breakers, these modifications likely would include the installation of dead-end structures, 
surge arresters, motor-operated disconnect switches, and remote SCADA control.  
The proposed transmission line route for Option 3 f ollows a cross-country corridor that 
would have significant environmental impacts as it crosses through rare and endangered 
species habitat, wetland resource areas, and the Wh itmans Pond and Old Swamp 
River/South Cove ORWs.  The corridor also parallels and is adjacent to French Stream and 
crosses the Old Swamp River.  The Option 3 Variatio n reroutes the majority of the line 
along existing roadways, thereby significantly redu cing potential environmental impacts.  
A portion of the cross country corridor would cross  the French Stream, bordering 
vegetated wetland, and mapped rare and endangered species habitat.  Option 3 Variation 
additionally would cross designated ORWs and the Ol d Swamp River, but would do so 
within the previously disturbed Bill Delahunt Parkway ROW. 
  
 
17    Option 3, like all transmission alternatives con sidered by HMLP, was first reviewed 
in 2018 and the estimated circuit length was 4.2 mi les.  More recently, HMLP 
identified a variation of this transmission alterna tive (hereinafter “Option 3 
Variation”) that would follow roadways to the exten t practicable and reduce 
impacts within wetlands and rare and endangered spe cies habitat, but this 
variation would be 5.12 miles long, adding addition al costs and reliability-related 
exposure to this alternative.

Option 3 (as well as Option 3 Variation) is similar to Option 1 in that it calls for construction 
of a new step-down station which requires integration of new distribution circuits into the 
existing HMLP system that is capable of carrying th e entirety of the HMLP loads. The 
distribution system work necessary to integrate thi s transmission alternative with the 
existing distribution system would likely be signif icant as there are a limited number of 
feeders in the area of Hingham Industrial Park with  limited street routes to connect to 
other feeders.  Considerable feeder work would be r equired to extend remote circuits to 
this location if they are to serve as a back up to Hobart Substation.  The significant work 
needed to integrate with the distribution system would increase the costs of this option. 
HMLP requested an analysis from NGRID regarding the reliability and cost impacts of HMLP 
tapping NGRID’s transmission lines.  The NGRID anal ysis from October 2018 indicated 
that existing transmission circuit reconductoring of portions of its transmission lines would 
be required for this option as a result of adding the HMLP load to the lines during an outage 
event.  The NGRID analysis identified that a DCT fa ult on the existing transmission lines 
serving HMLP followed by loss of the S9 line would transfer all of HMLP’s load as well as 
all of the S9 line load onto the C3 Line.  Based on  the 2023 summer peak load forecast 
condition, this would result in overloading the seg ment of the C3 line between Auburn 
Street #451 and Plymouth #93 beyond its Summer Long Term Emergency (“LTE”) rating.  
Since the C3 line is a Bulk Power System (BPS) line  (as defined by NERC), this N-1-1 
contingency condition needs to be respected, and NG RID’s line segment would require 
reconductoring.  Based on NGRID’s estimate that 3.3 miles 18  of existing transmission line 
would need to be reconductored for both the C3 circ uit as well as the S9 circuit for this 
option, HMLP calculated an additional cost of appro ximately $10 million, not including all 
other POI costs and other potential terminal point upgrades. 
HMLP’s total estimated cost for Option 3 is $145 Million (See TABLE 3-2), with the cost of 
Option 3A (Variation) estimated at $153.5 Million ( See Error! Reference source not 
found. ).  This estimate includes the estimated costs asso ciated with reconductoring of 
NGRID C3 and S9 circuits, construction of 4.2 miles of a 115kV underground transmission 
line (5.12 miles for Option 3 Variation), interconn ection of the new 115kV transmission 
line to the North Abington substation and a new substation at the Hingham Industrial Park 
to step down the transmission voltage to 13.8kV.  T hese costs do not include land 
acquisition costs for a new substation at the Hingham Industrial Park or at the NGRID tap 
in Abington, a transmission easement, or the additi onal HMLP distribution system 
upgrades necessary to provide backup capacity to serve the rest of Hingham.  
 
18   HMLP concluded that the total transmission line m ileage that would require 
reconductoring includes 3.3 miles of the C3 circuit  as well as 3.3 miles of the S9 
circuit between Auburn substation and Plymouth Stre et substation, for a total of 
6.6 miles.  Although not specifically identified in  the NGRID analysis, it was 
observed that the C3 and S9 circuits provide backup  service for each other such 
that failure of either of these circuits results in  all load being transferred to the 
remaining in-service circuit. The C3 and S9 circuit s have similar ratings which led 
HMLP to the consideration that since the C3 circuit was found to be overloaded for 
loss of the S9 circuit followed by a DCT fault inte rrupting both of the Hingham 
supply circuits, an overload would also occur on th e S9 circuit for loss of the C3 
circuit followed by a DCT fault interrupting both of the Hingham supply circuits.

As summarized in Section 3.3.4.8 below, the cost of  Option 3 (or Option 3 Variation) as 
estimated by HMLP is significantly higher than the cost of Option 2.  Moreover, Option 3 
(and Option 3 Variation) would result in a somewhat lower level of reliability as it requires 
a longer underground transmission line than Option 2 (~1.8 miles longer underground 
cable) as well as an additional 2 miles of radial overhead transmission associated with the 
C3-99 line running from Plymouth Street substation to North Abington substation #99.  
Additionally, substantial distribution system costs would be required to fully integrate the 
new substation with the distribution system current ly fed out of the existing Hobart 
substation based on a design that would allow the new substation to carry the entire Town 
of Hingham loads. 
Finally, Option 3 Variation for the underground route to a new substation at the Hingham 
Industrial Park also has greater environmental impacts than Option 2 based on the longer 
underground route required and the cross country co rridor segment that would cross 
through previously undisturbed wetland resource are as, including French Stream, and 
habitat for rare and endangered species. In additio n, integrating the distribution system 
would require considerable feeder work to extend re mote circuits to the Industrial Park 
and would likely result in further environmental impacts.

Accordingly, although Option 3 (as well as Option 3  Variation) satisfies the identified 
reliability need and is considered to be a feasible project alternative, as set out in Section 
3.3.4.8 below, Option 2 was deemed superior to Opti on 3 (and Option 3 Variation) with 
respect to cost, reliability and minimizing environmental impacts 
3.3.4.4 Underground Transmission line from Norwell Station to Union Street to 
Hobart Street (Option 4) 
This transmission alternative (Option 4) would tap into NGRID’s 115kV C3 Line near 
Norwell substation and extend the 115kV line northwest for approximately 7.5 miles.  The 
115kV C3 Line is a radial line supplied from the Au burn Street substation.  The C3 Line 
essentially parallels the S9 Line, and the two lines supply several load serving substations 
in the South Shore area, including substations at P lymouth Street #93, North Abington 
#99, Philips Lane #95, Water Street #910, Norwell # 96, and Scituate #915 (See Figure 
3-7).  In the event of loss of either of the two li nes, all of the load that is served by both 
lines would be picked up by the remaining line, eit her automatically or by way of post-
contingency operator switching. 
Figure 3-7 One Line Diagram Showing NGRID’s C3 and S9 Transmission Lines 
and Associated Substations 
 
This transmission alternative would extend overhead  from the existing NGRID Norwell 
substation #96 approximately 3 miles northwest along the existing NGRID ROW.  The line 
then would diverge at the Aaron Reservoir onto a ne w overhead ROW extending west for 
1.25 miles towards Union Street, then extend northwest along Union Street an additional 
1.25 miles to a parcel at Union Street in Hingham, where a new substation could be 
constructed at a later date.   From Union Street th e line would be routed west along 
existing NGRID ROW and then north along Cross Stree t and west along Hobart Street 
(approximately 1.9 miles).  The segment of the line within Cross Street and Hobart Street 
would be underground.   
A new substation would be built at Hobart Street.  The work at the proposed substation 
would include breakers and/or motor operated switch es, and a control house to allow for 
the ability to sectionalize the 115kV feeders into Hobart and feed the existing Hobart 
substation via one of the existing lines from Weymouth, and the new C3 Transmission line 
extension.  One of the existing 115kV feeds from We ymouth would serve as a reserve or 
a standby feed to back up the existing and new tran smission lines which follow separate 
routes.  
A geographic diagram of this project alternative (Option 4) is provided in Figure 3-8.

HMLP requested an analysis from NGRID which include d consideration of this option 
regarding the reliability and performance impacts o f HMLP tapping NGRID’s transmission 
lines.  The NGRID assessment evaluated a similar se t of contingency conditions where a 
DCT fault on the transmission circuits serving HMLP  was followed by loss of the S9 
transmission line.  If all of HMLP’s load were serv ed by the C3 Line out of Norwell 
substation #96, for a 2023 summer peak load forecas t condition, the segment of the C3 
line running from Auburn Street substation #451 to Plymouth Street substation #93, as 
well as the segments running from Plymouth Street s ubstation #93 to Philips Lane 
substation #95 and Philips Lane substation #95 to N orwell substation #96 would all 
exceed their summer LTE ratings.  Since the C3 line is a BPS line, this N-1-1 contingency 
condition needs to be respected, and NGRID’s line s egments would require 
reconductoring.  Additionally, since the C3 circuit and the S9 circuit provide backup service 
for each other and given that the two circuits have  similar ratings, it was concluded that 
both the C3 and S9 circuits would need to be recond uctored between Auburn Street 
substation #451 and Norwell substation #96.  Based on these assumptions, the estimated 
total length of circuit reconductoring would be 24.8 miles (12.4 miles 19  x 2) for this option. 
HMLP has calculated the cost of these upgrades to b e estimated at $36.6 Million, which 
does not include all other POI costs and other terminal point upgrades.  
The new 7.5-mile transmission line required for thi s option would result in considerably 
greater construction costs and environmental impact s relative to other options, 
particularly within the segment required for a new overhead easement that runs cross 
country through previously undisturbed areas.  This  route crosses areas mapped as rare 
and endangered species habitat, extensive and inter connected wetland resource areas, 
designated ORW (Aaron River Reservoir and Lily Pond ), as well as protected open space 
(Wampatuck State Park).  A new transmission line ea sement within Wampatuck State 
Park would be subject to the provisions of Article 97 of the Massachusetts Constitution, 
including requiring a 2/3 vote of the Legislature. The segment of new overhead easement 
would require at least 11 new wetland resource area  crossings within the Wampatuck 
State Park boundaries.  Use of the existing NGRID R OW west of the Union Street Parcel 
 
19    The total transmission line mileage that would r equire reconductoring includes 3.3 
miles of the C3 circuit between Auburn Street substation #451 and Plymouth Street 
substation #93; 3.1 miles of the C3 circuit from Pl ymouth Street substation #93 
to Philips Lane substation #95; and 6 miles of the C3 circuit from Philips Lane 
substation #95 to Norwell substation #96. HMLP conc luded that the total 
transmission line mileage that would require reconductoring includes 12.4 miles of 
the C3 circuit as well as 12.4 miles of the S9 circ uit between Auburn Street 
substation #451 and Norwell substation #96, for a t otal of 24.8 miles.  Although 
not specifically identified in the NGRID analysis, it was observed that the C3 and 
S9 circuits provide backup service for each other such that failure of either of these 
circuits results in all load being transferred to the remaining in-service circuit. The 
C3 and S9 circuits have similar ratings which led H MLP to the consideration that 
since the C3 circuit was found to be overloaded for  loss of the S9 circuit followed 
by a DCT fault interrupting both of the Hingham supply circuits, an overload would 
also occur on the S9 circuit for loss of the C3 cir cuit followed by a DCT fault 
interrupting both of the Hingham supply circuits.

would also require significant environmental impact s as the ROW runs parallel to Tower 
Brook and crosses extensive wetland resource areas.   
This option was eliminated from further considerati on by HMLP because of (1) the 
significant costs associated with extensive circuit  reconductoring of considerable portions 
of NGRID’s lines, reconductoring that would be requ ired to reliably integrate the HMLP 
load that could be placed upon the lines to serve H ingham during an outage event; (2) 
the cost of construction of a new 7.5-mile transmis sion line through environmentally 
challenging areas; and (3) the potential environmen tal impacts associated with 
construction in areas with rare and endangered spec ies, wetland resources, ORW and 
protected open space.   
3.3.4.5 Underground Transmission line from POI on E versource Circuit 478-502 
in Weymouth near MBTA ROW, then along MBTA Rail Lin e to Hobart 
Street (Option 5) 
This transmission alternative (Option 5) includes a new 3.25-mile underground line, which 
would start at the Eversource ROW corridor near Bro ad Street (Lines 478-502/478-509), 
but would tap a different location than the propose d project (Option 2), one closer to the 
intersection between the Eversource ROW corridor an d the MBTA ROW.  This alternative 
would follow the MBTA rail line and a similar route  to a new Hobart Street substation as 
the existing HMLP transmission lines.   
A geographic diagram of this project alternative (Option 5) is provided in Figure 3-9. 
There are significant constructability concerns regarding installation of a new underground 
transmission line along the MBTA tracks.  The MBTA ROW is a major public transportation 
route for commuters, which includes overhead electric transmission lines that run parallel 
to the tracks within the ROW.  Space between the ra ils and the electric transmission line 
is limited and the majority of the ROW is too narro w to support the Project’s required 
width for the duct bank construction.     
It is anticipated that areas where typical open trench excavation will occur will require an 
approximately 11-foot wide workspace area.  Manhole  and splice vault installations 
typically require an approximately 20-foot wide work area.  Again, much of the MBTA ROW 
is narrow, and there is limited space between rails , other infrastructure associated with 
the railroad, and existing electric transmission infrastructure to support the required width 
for the duct bank construction. 
It would not be feasible for the project to meet th e requirements of the MBTA Railroad 
Operations Directorate, dated August 2014, which pr ovides specifications for siting and 
construction of utilities along the rail lines.  Th e MBTA Directorate requires that 
construction activity be limited to hours when the MBTA is not running (midnight to 5 
a.m., at best) when in close proximity to rail.  Construction equipment used for the project 
would be required to be brought into and removed fr om the site at the end of each 
construction period.  For excavation longitudinally  along the rail line, shoring would need 
to be installed prior to excavation.  The time cons traints and construction requirements 
would add months, if not years, to the project, which, in turn, would add significant costs.

In addition, at some point the proposed transmission line would need to cross a rail line(s).  
The crossing would need to be within a casing, and there is not adequate space for jacking 
and receiving pits within the MBTA ROW.  The use of the MBTA ROW is not feasible due to 
the lack of space needed for jacking and receiving pits and the lack of space for installation 
of required manholes.  For any manholes installed w ithin the MBTA ROW, access to 
manholes would be restricted, severely impacting el ectrical system operations and 
maintenance.   
From an environmental perspective, this option woul d require four (4) existing culvert 
crossings including the tidally influenced Weymouth  Back River and stream/wetland 
crossings.  As there is limited space within the MB TA right of way near these resources, 
temporary impacts to adjacent wetland resource area s may be unavoidable.  Also, the 
crossings of the Weymouth Back River may require tr enchless technologies to minimize 
impacts at the crossing locations.   
As noted above, the location of the tap station wou ld be near the intersection of the 
Eversource ROW with the MBTA ROW.  The Eversource ROW in this area includes extensive 
wetland resource areas both north and south of the MBTA tracks, and finding a site for a 
new tap station would be challenging.
20    
In addition, HMLP identified five (5) bridge (non-environmental) crossings along the MBTA 
ROW -- Idlewell Street and Narraganset Avenue are r ailroad underpasses and North 
Street, Green Street, and at East Weymouth Substati on (N. Wharf Street) are railroad 
bridges.  The underpasses may limit the area alongs ide the railroad track to install the 
line.  The bridges would need to be assessed to see  if they can accommodate the 
transmission line.  If not, a trenchless technology may be required to install the line under 
the bridges and roadways that the bridges cross.  Accordingly, construction cost estimates 
for this alternative are considerably higher than f or alternatives that avoid such bridge 
crossings.   
This transmission alternative was not considered a viable alternative and was eliminated 
from further consideration because of the construct ion, siting and timing constraints 
associated with working within the narrow and activ e MBTA ROW and the considerable 
wetlands impacts associated with this tap station location. 
3.3.4.6 Replacement of the DCTs with Single Monopol es for Each Portion of the 
Circuit Where There Are Presently DCTs (Option 6A) 
This transmission alternative (Option 6A) would inv olve eliminating the DCT failure 
scenario by installing new monopoles to replace DCT  structures along both the NGRID-
owned and HMLP-owned portion of the lines currently  serving Hingham.  A review of the 
current pathways shows that HMLP owns 12 metal DCTs, and 3 wood DCTs, while NGRID 
owns and operates approximately 7 steel DCTs upstre am of the HMLP-owned portion of 
the lines.  (Table 2-2 provides an overview of pole s, including DCTs, by ownership and 
composition (wood vs. metal), along the existing transmission feed.) 
 
20    The tap station for Option 5 also potentially co uld be sited near Broad Street as 
described in Option 2; however, extending the trans mission line north within the 
Eversource ROW from Broad Street to the MBTA tracks  would result in additional 
impacts to wetland resource areas.

A geographic diagram of this project alternative (O ption 6A) as well as Option 6B is 
provided in Figure 3-10.   
The HMLP portion of the line first was investigated  to evaluate the possibility of replacing 
all DCTs with separate monopole single towers.  HML P’s review showed that there is a 
curve on the section of track near East Weymouth Su bstation with limited room to add 
another pole along that section of rail track.  Therefore, HMLP determined that in order to 
accomplish this transmission alternative, HMLP woul d need to install overhead poles in 
residential neighborhoods, or install poles on both sides of streets within Hingham.  While 
both of these options are technically possible, HML P determined they were unacceptable 
because of the visual impacts of new transmission p oles on residential streets.  Notably, 
in Hingham Municipal Lighting Plant , EFSC 85-65, 14 DOMSC 7, 25-27, 32 (1976), the 
Siting Council required HMLP to use single wooden D CTs for certain portions of the 
approved line.  Adding additional pole structures in residential neighborhoods near Hobart 
Station likely would be poorly received by municipal officials and neighbors.  Finally, even 
if it were feasible to install separate monopoles i n neighborhoods near Hobart Substation 
in Hingham, this would not eliminate the current N- 1 contingency because, as discussed 
herein, DCTs along the NGRID-owned upstream portion of the current route still would be 
present. 
The NGRID portion of the line also was investigated  to evaluate the possibility of adding 
separate monopole single towers upstream from East Weymouth Substation.  HMLP’s 
engineers independently conducted a high-level review of the NGRID-owned and operated 
upstream portion of the route, and that review showed that the DCTs currently follow the 
railroad tracks and likely were placed along portio ns of the line where there were curves 
in the track, and where there was not enough room or clearance along the tracks to place 
two single poles.  Installation of additional monopoles on the NGRID portion of the current 
route is considered not practical at this time and was eliminated as an option since the 
solution involves significant construction constrai nts and also may require acquisition of 
private property along the rail route to allow for placement of new poles.   
Finally, removing one of the lines from the DCTs an d placing that line on separate 
monopoles would not meet the identified need, i.e ., this alternative addresses the N-1 
DCT contingency, but does not address the N-1-1 con tingency where one line has failed 
or is undergoing maintenance, and the second line experiences an outage.  
In sum, HMLP eliminated this alternative from furth er consideration because it fails to 
address the identified need.  Moreover, this altern ative was deemed not to be viable 
because (1) HMLP likely would be required to acquire additional land on the NGRID portion 
of the line in Weymouth in order to install separat e monopoles; and (2) installation of 
separate monopoles in Hingham would result in an in crease in visual impacts that likely 
would not be acceptable to municipal officials and residents.

3.3.4.7 Placement of One of the Existing Transmissi on Lines Underground to 
Eliminate the DCT Contingency (Option 6B) 
This transmission alternative (Option 6B) would inv olve installing an underground line 
adjacent to the existing lines to eliminate the DCT  failure scenario.  As with the 
consideration of replacing DCTs with separate overhead structures along the current route 
(Option 6A), to effectively remove the risk of a single tower failure, this underground plan 
would need to be implemented from Hobart Street and  along the entire length of the 
railroad ROW to the Eversource ROW, i.e ., covering both the HMLP-owned and NGRID-
owned portions of the existing line.    
A geographic diagram of this project alternative (Option 6B) is provided in Figure 3-10. 
As a threshold issue, like Option 6A, removing one of the existing lines and placing that 
line underground would not fully meet the identified need, i.e ., this alternative addresses 
the N-1 DCT contingency, but does not address the N-1-1 contingency where one line has 
failed or is undergoing maintenance, and the second line experiences an outage. 
Four additional issues were identified regarding th is alternative which were viewed as 
significant design and constructability impediments.  
• First, between East Weymouth substations and the Ev ersource ROW, most of the 
single pole circuit structures are located adjacent to the track area but on opposite 
sides of the track.  This configuration leaves very  little room for installation of an 
underground duct bank.  HMLP believes this creates a very difficult work condition 
to install an underground cable system, especially on an active railroad ROW.  
Moreover, addressing these construction constraints  would add considerable cost 
to the project.  These considerations all lead to a substantially higher cost estimate 
for this option.  
• Second, this alternative would require four (4) exi sting crossings of wetland 
resource areas including the tidally influenced Wey mouth Back River.  As there is 
limited space within the MBTA right of way near the se resources, temporary 
impacts to adjacent wetland resource areas may be unavoidable.  These crossings, 
particularly the Weymouth Back River, may require t renchless technologies to 
minimize impacts at the crossing locations, resulting in construction cost increases.    
• Third, HMLP identified five (5) bridge crossings (n on-environmental) along the 
existing route - Idlewell Street and Narraganset Avenue are railroad underpasses, 
and North Street, Green Street, and at East Weymout h Substation (N. Wharf 
Street) are railroad bridges.  The underpasses may limit the area alongside the 
railroad track to install the line.  The bridges wo uld need to be assessed to see if 
they can accommodate the transmission line.  If not, a trenchless technology may 
be required to install the line under the bridges a nd roadways that the bridges 
cross.  This also leads to the conclusion that cons truction cost estimates will be 
higher for this alternative than alternatives with routes that avoid such bridge 
crossings.   
• Fourth, constructing an underground transmission li ne in a railroad ROW raises 
significant timing and coordination issues, as desc ribed for Option 5 in Section 
3.3.4.5.

In sum, HMLP eliminated this alternative from furth er consideration because it fails to 
meet the identified need.  Moreover, this alternative was deemed to be infeasible by HMLP 
because of the costs associated with mitigating environmental impacts and the impacts of 
multiple bridge crossings.  Further, building along  an active rail line creates construction 
and timing challenges and results in substantially higher costs under the best scenario.  
3.3.4.8 Evaluation of Transmission Alternatives (Co mparison of 7 Options) 
In the previous sections, HMLP has provided the res ults of its investigation into the 
transmission alternatives that could potentially me et the need identified in Section 2 of 
the Petition.  This investigation and analysis incl uded extensive reviews of the designs, 
construction requirements, system integration requi rements, environmental impacts and 
costs associated with all of the transmission alternatives. The results of HMLP’s comparison 
of transmission alternatives are summarized in Table 3-4 below.

As noted above, Options 1, 4, 5, 6A and 6B were eli minated from further consideration 
because they were not viable. 
With respect to the remaining project alternatives,  Option 2 is estimated to cost $40.6 
Million less than Option 3 (and $48.8 Million less than Option 3 Variation).  Moreover, as 
explained in Section 3.3.4.3 above, the reliability  and environmental impacts associated 
with Option 3 (and Option 3 Variation) are notably less favorable, and these factors 
coupled with potentially substantial distribution system related costs led HMLP to conclude 
that its proposed transmission alternative, Option 2, is clearly superior to alternative 
transmission approaches in terms of cost, environme ntal impact, reliability and ability to 
meet the identified need. 
3.4 Distribution Alternatives 
HMLP has concluded that an alternative based solely  on distribution system additions or 
modifications would not be viable as the town of Hi ngham has only one substation and 
loss of that substation due to a transmission syste m outage interrupts service to all 
distribution facilities serving the town.   
As set forth above, no distribution alternatives were considered as a means to address the 
identified need.  There currently is only one subst ation in Hingham.  Unlike other large 
investor-owned utilities which often operate multiple substations in an area - and can use 
distribution ties from adjacent substations upon loss of transmission lines or a substation 
- HMLP has no other substations to leverage in the event of either a N-1 or N-1-1 
contingency.

3.5 Non-Transmission Alternatives 
As discussed in Section 3.3.1 above, HMLP’s firm lo ad capability is 80 MVA (Historical 
summer peak load is 57 MVA) and under N-1 or N-1-1 outages, alternative solution load 
carrying capacity must be able to supply at least a s much as HMLP’s existing firm load 
capability.  Viable alternatives for addressing the identified need must provide at least 80 
MVA of peak load capacity while continuing to be av ailable under both N-1 and N-1-1 
contingency conditions for anywhere from 8 hours to  one week or more in duration.  
Therefore, any non-transmission alternative also must be able to serve up to 80 MVA and 
be available for extended periods of time -- for as  long as from 8 hours up to a week or 
more -- which is considered to be the minimum amoun t of time necessary to ensure the 
availability of supply for the town of Hingham resulting from loss of transmission service.  
HMLP considered the following non-transmission alte rnatives for meeting the identified 
need: 
(1)  Conservation efforts or interruption of firm and non-firm load   
(2)  Wind resource 
(3)  Solar with batteries  
3.5.1 Conservation/Interruption of Firm and Non-firm Load (NTA Option 
1) 
This option does not meet the identified need becau se residents and businesses in 
Hingham would be without power when both lines are lost.  Unlike larger utilities, HMLP 
cannot switch load to a “back-up substation”; thus,  neither conservation nor so-called 
“rolling blackouts” – or some combination of the tw o – are feasible.  Conservation or 
partial load interruption would not avoid interrupt ion of service to all HMLP customers 
since the N-1 or N-1-1 outage would interrupt all service to the town. 
3.5.2 Wind Resource (NTA Option 2) 
A wind solution would require approximately 35 to 4 0 2.5MW turbines.  Typical siting for 
a land-based wind turbine would require approximately 30-40 acres per turbine.  HMLP is 
not aware of any proposed projects to construct this number of turbines as a single service 
territory solution, and there is no available land of this magnitude in Hingham.  Existing 
tracts of undeveloped land within the Town are typi cally dense with environmental 
resources and/or are protected open space subject t o Article 97.  Construction of a land-
based wind generation facility would result in sign ificant land use impacts.  Additionally, 
due to the intermittent nature of wind generation, battery storage capacity would also 
need to be included in the design. 
Offshore wind was ruled out since there are no conn ections to the HMLP infrastructure 
that could be used to serve as a backstop to the existing transmission system.  And, even 
if sufficient land were available, wind as a solution is intermittent which precludes it as an 
option absent additional energy storage capabilitie s.  Further, offshore wind and 
interconnection to the existing transmission system  would require extensive 
environmental permitting and impact mitigation. 
This alternative was considered to be cost prohibitive given the equipment costs and land 
acquisition costs needed to site this number of win d generation units as well as battery 
storage capacity.

Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project  
EFSB Petition 
 3-30 
3.5.3 Solar/Battery (NTA Option 3) 
Because solar is an intermittent resource, HMLP con sidered a non-transmission option 
combining solar with battery storage.  Notably, bat tery storage systems typically only 
have two to four hours of availability; therefore, either individually or combined, this 
solution would require an extensive battery storage system that would be able to provide 
from 8 hours up to a week of firm supply to meet pe ak demand during a N-1 or N-1-1 
contingency as outlined in Sections 1.3 and 3.5 above.  In addition, a combination of solar 
and battery storage would require approximately 900  acres with a cost of over 
$160,000,000 for 80 MVA.  Both the land requirement s and the costs make this option 
infeasible as a solution.  As described for the NTA  Option 2 wind resource (see Section 
3.5.2), existing tracts of undeveloped land within the Town are typically dense with 
environmental resources and/or are protected open s pace subject to Article 97. 
Construction of a solar generation and battery storage facility, or combination of separate 
facilities, would likely require substantial enviro nmental impacts, permitting, and 
mitigation. Similarly, this alternative was considered cost prohibitive due to the equipment 
and land acquisition costs. 21  
3.5.4 Evaluation of Non-Transmission Alternatives (Comparison of 3 NTA 
Options) 
The non-transmission alternatives considered by HML P either do not meet the identified 
need as described in Section 2 or are significantly  more expensive than the transmission 
alternatives that were developed.  Moreover, it would not be possible for HMLP to acquire 
the land necessary to develop a wind option or mult iple solar plus battery options that 
would meet the identified need.  And, even if there  was sufficient available land to site 
wind or multiple solar plus battery facilities in Hingham, the cost would be prohibitive and 
would result in greater land use and environmental impacts than the transmission 
alternatives. 
Accordingly, HMLP eliminated all non-transmission alternatives from further consideration 
and HMLP determined that there is no non-transmissi on alternative (or combination of 
non-transmission alternatives) that meet the system  reliability need identified in Section 
2.  
3.6 Conclusion on Project Alternatives 
In Section 3.2, HMLP established that a no-build al ternative did not meet the system 
reliability identified in Section 2 and leaves the Town of Hingham vulnerable to an 
extended outage.  
In Section 3.3, HMLP identified and analyzed seven transmission alternatives (eight, 
including the Option 3 Variation) and eliminated fi ve of those options – Option 1, Option 
4, Option 5, Option 6, and Option 6A – because they  are not viable alternatives to meet 
the identified need.  Of the remaining viable alter natives, Option 2 – an underground 
transmission line from a new point of interconnecti on on Eversource circuit 478-502 in 
Weymouth to a new substation near the existing Hoba rt Substation in Hingham – was 
 
21   Similarly, a standalone battery system would fail  to meet the identified need and 
would be infeasible.  Indeed, a standalone battery system (absent a solar 
component) would have no opportunity or ability to recharge during an extended 
outage.

determined by HMLP to be clearly superior to Option  3 (and Option 3 Variation) in terms 
of cost, environmental impact, reliability and ability to meet the identified need. 
Finally, in Section 3.4, HMLP determined that there is no non-transmission alternative (or 
combination of non-transmission alternatives) that meets the system reliability need 
identified in Section 2. 
Accordingly, HMLP has established that, on balance,  its proposed project (Option 2) is 
superior to alternative approaches in terms of cost , environmental impact, and ability to 
meet the identified need.  In addition, HMLP has considered reliability of supply as part of 
its showing that its proposed project is superior to alternative project approaches.

Selection 
4.1 Introduction and Overview 
As presented in Section 3, HMLP’s proposed solution  to address the reliability need 
identified in Section 2 involves the construction of a new 115kV underground transmission 
line from a new point of interconnection at Eversou rce-owned transmission lines in 
Weymouth and a new HMLP substation in Hingham.  Thi s Section describes the process 
by which HMLP identified and evaluated possible loc ations for a tap station in Weymouth 
and a substation in Hingham, as well as possible ro utes between the tap station and 
substation to determine the Preferred Route for the  Project and a Noticed Alternative 
Route. 
4.1.1 Standard of Review 
The Siting Board has a statutory mandate to impleme nt the policies of G.L. c. 164, §§ 
69J-69Q to provide a reliable energy supply for the  Commonwealth with a minimum 
impact on the environment at the lowest possible cost (G.L. c. 164, §§ 69H, 69J).  Further, 
Section 69J requires the Siting Board to review alternatives to planned projects, including 
“other site locations.”  In implementing this statutory mandate, the Siting Board requires 
a petitioner to demonstrate that it has considered a reasonable range of practical project 
and siting alternatives and that the proposed facilities are sited at locations that minimize 
costs and environmental impacts while ensuring supply reliability.  To do so, an applicant 
must satisfy a two-pronged test and demonstrate tha t it has: (1) developed and applied 
a reasonable set of criteria to identify and evalua te alternative routes in a manner that 
ensures that no routes were overlooked or eliminated that, on balance, are clearly superior 
to the proposed route; and (2) identified at least two noticed sites or routes with some 
measure of geographic diversity.   NSTAR Electric Company d/b/a Eversource Energy ,

The following subsections describe the route select ion process developed by HMLP in 
accordance with the above-cited requirements. 
4.1.2 Routing Analysis Overview 
HMLP assessed options to address the identified rel iability need by connecting Hingham 
to the grid with a third 115kV transmission line th at is geographically distinct from the 
existing two transmission lines.   The process for the transmission line routing could not 
begin until the locations for a substation in Hingh am and a tap station to connect to the 
Eversource transmission lines in Weymouth were identified.   
Several sites were assessed in Hingham (for the New  Substation), in proximity to the 
existing Hobart Substation, and in Weymouth (for th e new Tap Station) along and in 
proximity to the Eversource transmission line right -of-way.  The sites were carefully

evaluated for a variety of factors as discussed bel ow to determine the preferred sites for 
both the substation and tap station.  Once these si tes were determined, then the routing 
analysis for the transmission line commenced.   
HMLP’s methodology for siting the proposed new electric transmission line, referred to as 
a “routing analysis,” is an adaptive and iterative approach to identify and evaluate possible 
routes for the proposed new transmission line in accordance with requirements described 
above.  The routing analysis identified the route f or the Project as the option that best 
balances minimization of environmental impacts (inc luding developed and natural 
environment impacts and constructability constraint s), cost and reliability.  The analysis 
also identified a Noticed Alternative Route that pr ovides a geographically distinct 
alternative to the Project, while also attempting to strike a balance of the aforementioned 
factors. 
The routing analysis methodology presented herein u ses previously established 
approaches for evaluating electric transmission rou ting options and is consistent with 
Siting Board precedent.  In initiating the routing analysis, HMLP first established routing 
objectives (described in more detail in the following subsections). 
4.1.3 Routing Analysis Objectives 
The goal of HMLP’s routing analysis was to identify  a technically feasible route that 
achieved the required transmission system reliabili ty improvements by interconnecting 
the proposed new tap station in Weymouth and the proposed new substation in Hingham.  
Additional consideration was given to the potential  impacts the candidate solutions may 
have on the developed and natural environment.  These objectives included: 
• Comply with all applicable statutory requirements, regulations and state and 
federal siting agency policies; 
• Achieve a reliable, operable and cost-effective solution; 
• Maximize the reasonable, practical and feasible use  of existing linear corridors 
(e.g., transmission line, highway, railroad, or pipeline ROWs); 
• Minimize the need to acquire property rights; and 
• Maximize the potential for direct routing options over circuitous routes. 
4.1.4 Methodology 
The routing analysis for the new line consisted of the following steps, discussed in more 
detail in subsequent sections: 
• Identification of Substation:  Focused on the identification of the new substation 
site within proximity of the existing “Hobart I” su bstation located in Hingham on 
Old Hobart Street. 
• Identification of Tap Station: Focused on the identification of the new tap 
station site within proximity of the existing Eversource ROW located in Weymouth.  
• Identification of Project Study Area:  Identified a geographic area extending 
between the proposed Tap Station in Weymouth and th e proposed Hobart II 
Substation in Hingham for purposes of commencing the routing analysis. 
• Development of Universe of Routes:  Identified numerous routing options and 
associated variations in the Project Study Area to develop a set of potential routes.

• Identification of Potential Candidate Routes:  Identified and described the 
viable routes from the Universe of Routes (collecti vely referred to herein as 
“Candidate Routes”) that met the need for the Proje ct and were consistent with 
the objectives of HMLP’s routing analysis. 
• Candidate Route Analysis:  Compared the potential for natural environment and 
built environment impacts and technical constructab ility constraints along the 
Candidate Routes. 
• Cost Analysis:  Compared the estimated costs for the Candidate Routes. 
• Reliability Analysis:  Compared the reliability of the Candidate Routes. 
• Selection of Routes:  Evaluated the results of the above analyses and identified a 
Preferred Route and a Noticed Alternative Route tha t best balance reliability, 
minimization of environmental impacts, constructability constraints and cost. 
4.1.5 Stakeholder Input 
In addition to the steps associated with route sele ction, HMLP representatives met with 
state and municipal officials, residents, business owners and other stakeholders to discuss 
the substation and tap station sites, as well as the Universe of Routes under consideration 
for the New Line, and to obtain input on these siti ng and routing options.  This process 
began in 2020 and, as of the date of this filing, has included more than 32 meetings (see 
Section 1.7 for additional discussion of the meetin gs).  The following table summarizes 
the input regarding siting and route selection obtained at these meetings.

listed.  In addition, this table may have omitted a dditional meetings where some of the same routing r elated 
topics were discussed and/or conveyed to HMLP .   
HMLP also contacted the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs Office of 
Environmental Justice & Equity for a list of Enviro nmental Justice Community Based 
Organizations (“CBOs”) in the project area.  A letter with project information and an offer 
to meet to discuss the Project was mailed to each CBO in March 2023.  No response was 
received.  
4.2 Ancillary Facilities Site Selection  
As described below, the first steps in HMLP’s analy sis were to identify the ancillary sites: 
a substation site in Hingham and a tap station site in Weymouth.  A desktop analysis was 
conducted for several sites for each ancillary facility.  The desktop analysis was performed 
to provide an evaluation of the physical space requ irements and potential constraints to 
siting facilities on the identified lots.  This des ktop analysis exercise included review of 
multiple environmental criteria as well as space constrictions.   
To evaluate the parcels for proposed development, t he following criteria were analyzed 
using MassGIS data (Bureau of Geographic Information): 
• Areas of Critical Environmental Concern  (ACEC) – Places in Massachusetts 
that receive special recognition because of the quality, uniqueness and significance 
of their natural and cultural resources. These area s are designated by the state’s 
EOEEA Secretary.

• Certified Vernal Pools/Potential Vernal Pools  – Seasonal depressional 
wetlands that are covered by shallow water for vari able periods from winter to 
spring but may be completely dry for most of the summer and fall.   
• Chapter 91  – Tideland jurisdiction under the jurisdiction of MassDEP under G.L. c. 
91 and the Waterways Regulations in 310 CMR 9.00. 
• Environmental Justice Populations  – Neighborhoods where 25% of the 
households have an annual median household income that is equal to or less than 
65% of the statewide median or 24% of its population is Minority or identifies as a 
household that has English Isolation. 
• Floodplain  – Area of low-lying ground adjacent to a stream or river that is formed 
mainly of river sediments and is subject to floodin g. A type of wetland resource 
that floods following storms, prolonged rainfall, or snowmelt.  
• Historic and Archeological Resources – Historical inventory cataloged by the 
Massachusetts Culture Resources Inventory System (MACRIS) MassGIS data layer 
maintained by the Massachusetts Historical Commission.  
• Land Use/Adjacent Land Use  – Land cover mapping from aerial imagery and 
land use derived from standardized assessor parcel information.  
• MassDEP Wetland/NWI Wetlands  – Includes open water, marshes, swamps, 
tidal flats, etc. Also includes hydrologic connections that appear to contain flowing 
water and flow into, out of, or between mapped wetlands.  
• NHESP Priority/Estimated Habitat Rare Species  – Habitat of state-listed rare 
species based on observations documented within the last 25 years.  
• Potential to Encounter Subsurface Contamination – Active Tier Classified Tier 
I and II sites, Activity and Use Limitation (AUL) s ites closed with ongoing 
maintenance conditions, Utility Related Abatement M easures (URAM) sites and 
Class C Temporary Solution sites.  
• Prime Farmland  - Land that has the best combination of physical a nd chemical

4.2.1 Hobart II Substation 
In order to maximize reliability, HMLP focused on s electing a site for the substation in 
proximity to the existing Hobart substation in Hing ham.  This proximity would allow for 
the two substations to be connected in a ring-bus c onfiguration, where one substation 
could backfeed the other. 
HMLP identified ten (10) town-owned parcels for consideration for a proposed substation. 
22   
An open-air substation requires approximately 1 to 1.5 acres of land.  An enclosed 
substation requires as little as 15,000 square feet , but preferably a minimum of 20,000 
square feet (approximately 1/2 acre).   
Ten (10) municipal properties within the vicinity o f the Hobart Substation were identified 
for desktop assessment.  The parcels analyzed are s hown on Figure 4-1 and in Table 4-2 
below.  None of the parcels or combination of parcels could accommodate the one acre of 
area needed for an open-air substation, so the anal ysis proceeded to identify areas that 
could accommodate an enclosed substation.  An enclo sed substation requires 
approximately ½ acre of land.  These areas were used to assess potential sites available.  
The initial desktop analysis identified a few issues that required further consideration: 
• The majority of sites were less than one acre, many  less than ½ acre.  The only 
site assessed with greater than one acre of land is  the Town of Hingham Transfer 
Station site.   
• Wetland resources further constrained most sites. 
Recognizing that there are a limited number of Town -owned parcels in the vicinity of the 
existing Hobart Substation, combining adjacent town -owned parcels was evaluated to 
achieve maximum developable area for a potential substation. 
 
 
22    As set forth in Section 1.2, as a municipal ligh t department, HMLP does not hold 
title to real property in its name; rather, once ac quired, it is placed under the 
custody and control of HMLP for light plant purposes by the Select Board after the 
Select Board has been duly authorized by Town Meeti ng. As such, HMLP faces 
certain obstacles with respect to acquiring private ly-owned property.  Because 
HMLP does not have authority to purchase privately- owned properties on its own, 
the Select Board first would need to be authorized by a Town Meeting vote to 
acquire land for HMLP’s purposes. Depending on the costs of a privately-owned site 
(notwithstanding the scarcity of land available for  development in Hingham), the 
purchase would likely need to be financed, which wo uld require Town Meeting 
approval. Purchases of property by municipalities a re subject to a lengthy public 
bidding process pursuant to G.L. c. 30B, § 16, which process might not lead to the 
most suitable site for a substation, causing delays and uncertainties and requiring 
additional requests for proposals.  As such, by pri marily focusing on sites already 
owned by the Town of Hingham, HMLP both (1) reduced  costs, i.e. , custody and 
control of most Hingham-owned properties not needed  for current Town purposes 
would be transferred to HMLP at no cost; and (2) removed uncertainties that HMLP 
would face by virtue of not having control over the  manner and timing of a 
purchase.

The wetlands mapped by MassGIS encroached onto many of the properties being analyzed 
as a possible site for the substation.  In order to  develop a more accurate picture of the 
impact of the wetland resources to the potential de velopment of the parcels, a Tighe & 
Bond wetland scientist conducted a field delineatio n of wetlands to identify the limits of 
these resource areas.  Information on wetlands constraints is provided below. 
Wetland Constraints  
The desktop analysis identified wetland resource ar eas as potentially significant 
constraints to development at the parcels analyzed.   The locations of the wetlands as 
delineated in the field were incorporated into the maps, and the jurisdictional buffer zones 
to the wetlands were added.  Based on communication with Loni Fournier, Senior Planner 
for the Hingham Conservation Commission, HMLP was i nformed that Conservation 
Commission approval for any work within the inner 5 0-foot buffer zone to a wetland, 
particularly if the buffer zone is previously undeveloped, would be extremely challenging, 
as the Conservation Commission regulates the buffer  zone as a “no touch” resource area 
through the Town of Hingham Wetlands Protection Bylaw (General Bylaws of the Town of 
Hingham, Article 22).   
HMLP attended a special meeting of Town of Hingham department heads on December 
14, 2020 to discuss the potential substation locati ons.  The wetland buffer zones were 
identified at that meeting as well, and it was reco gnized that the wetlands-related 
restrictions, specifically the 50-foot no touch buf fer zone, resulted in elimination of 
potential sites, pushing the preferred location of the substation to the parcel 106-0-61.

In order to confirm the Conservation Commission’s o pinion on allowing work in the 50-
foot buffer zone, HMLP met with the Conservation Co mmission informally at their 
December 21, 2020 meeting.  HMLP presented the loca tion of the sites that were being 
analyzed and the restrictions on those sites placed  by the 50-foot buffer zone.  The 
Conservation Commission confirmed that they would n ot approve work within the 
undisturbed inner 50-foot buffer zone to wetland re source areas.  The Commission 
recognized that this requirement would push the pot ential substation to a location that 
was closer to residential abutters.  
Summary of the Site Analysis 
The site analysis incorporated the desktop analysis , field delineation, and input from the 
Conservation Commission.  A summary of each site and the pros and cons of the sites are 
listed below. Adjacent parcels 106-0-19 and 106-0-18 were evaluated on the assumption 
that they could be combined to potentially provide the space necessary for the proposed 
substation. No other combination of parcels provide d the adequate space and/or shape 
for the proposed substation.  The usable area identified below is the contiguous area within 
the property that is not constrained by environment al resources, including the 50-foot 
wetlands buffer zone.

operations is difficult and limited due to the capped landfill, adjacent open space 
surrounding the transfer station, and site grades.  
• Usable area: HMLP held a number of discussions with Randy Sylvester, the DPW 
Superintendent, who had initially stated that there was not available space on the 
transfer station site to accommodate an expansion or new enclosed substation.    
• Site Summary: After receiving negative public input on the use of Parcel 106-0-
61 for the substation, HMLP reevaluated potential options within the transfer 
station parcel.  Moreover, in meetings with the Hingham Select Board and 
Advisory Committee in the first quarter of 2021, HMLP was encouraged to revisit 
the transfer station property.   An approximately ½ acre area of undeveloped 
land was later identified at the northeastern corner of the transfer station parcel, 
adjacent to the exit road.  This area has adequate capacity for the proposed 
substation and will not have a significant impact on the transfer station 
operations.   
 
167-0-28: 308 Cushing Street (Former HMLP Facility)  
This site is located approximately 2 miles from Hobart I Substation.  This site was 
assessed in addition to the 10 sites in proximity to Hobart I Substation. 
• Total Site Area: Approximately 2.3 acres  
• Site Constraints: In order to connect this location to the main grid and tie the 
new substation to the existing Hobart Substation, approximately 7 additional 
miles of transmission main would need to be installed, including the installation 
of three transmission mains within Cushing Street.  This additional length of 
underground electric transmission line reduces reliability and increases the 
potential for infrastructure failures.     
After assessment of several parcels, a portion of the Hingham Transfer Station parcel was 
identified for the new Hobart II Substation.   
4.2.2 Weymouth Tap Station 
Based on the reliability assessment discussed in Se ction 3, HMLP focused on connecting 
to Eversource’s transmission lines in Weymouth.  HMLP’s assessment of potential tap sites 
focused on properties within and adjacent to the existing Eversource electric transmission 
ROW.  Five (5) lots in proximity to the intersection of the transmission line ROW and Broad 
Street were initially assessed.  HMLP also performe d a comprehensive assessment of an 
additional ten (10) parcels along the right-of-way in Weymouth.   
Five (5) parcels were assessed at the intersection of the Eversource ROW with Broad 
Street in Weymouth. A desktop assessment was performed on three (3) parcels owned by 
public utility companies (National Grid and Eversource) north of Broad Street.  These lots 
are depicted on Figure 4-2 and the assessment of these parcels is summarized in Table 4-
3.  In addition, the two (2) lots that make up the parking lot on the south side of Broad 
Street were also assessed (see Figure 4-2).  These lots (parcels 20-283-34 and 20-283-
3) are owned by Electroswitch.  HMLP reached out to Electroswitch regarding the potential 
to acquire a portion of the parking lot for a tap s tation.  Electroswitch indicated that it 
needed the parking area to serve its facility, and assessment of these lots was not pursued 
further.

The desktop analysis for the public utility owned p arcels identified only the Eversource-
owned parcel 20-220-1, a 11.67-acre parcel, as havi ng adequate unconstrained area for 
a new tap station within an existing utility ROW.  The two smaller lots adjacent to the 
ROW, owned by National Grid, were heavily constrain ed by wetland resources.  One lot 
was less than ¼ acre.  The larger lot (1.5 acres) was constrained by wetlands and a stream 
that restricts the entire frontage of the parcel fr om Broad Street.  Furthermore, both of 
these lots directly abut residential properties.   
To confirm there was not a better tap station site,  the ROW bounded by the Weymouth 
Fore River to the north and Route 53 to the south w as reviewed for potential tap station 
sites.  Here, an additional ten (10) properties were identified for assessment.  The parcels 
analyzed are shown on Figure 4-2 and the desktop an alysis of all parcels is summarized 
in Table 4-3.  The majority of parcels were heavily constrained by wetland resource areas.  
One parcel was protected open space.  Four (4) parc els that are privately owned at the 
southern end of the study area have adequate space,  but the connection to these lots 
would increase the length of the new transmission by one mile within roadways, or require 
wetland resource area crossings. 
23  
The Eversource parcel (20-220-1) was determined to be the preferred site for the 
proposed tap station due to its proximity to the electric transmission lines, the availability 
of land that is less constrained by environmental resource areas, its current use as electric 
transmission infrastructure and its closer proximity to the proposed Hobart II Substation, 
which both reduces costs by shortening the length o f transmission lines needed for the 
interconnection, and generally reduces impacts to t he community associated with 
construction in public ways.  Furthermore, the location on the ROW has no close residential 
or sensitive abutters.

4.3 Identification of Project Study Area  
Following the establishment of the routing objectives, HMLP reviewed the region between 
the proposed Weymouth Tap Station and the proposed Hobart II Substation and 
demarcated a geographic “Project Study Area,” as depicted in Figure 4-3, within which to 
concentrate the investigation of potential routes. 
The Project Study Area is located between the two end points in Weymouth and Hingham. 
The western boundary of the Project Study Area was the proposed interconnection with 
the HMLP transmission line at Broad Street in Weymo uth.  The eastern boundary of the 
Project Study Area is the proposed substation site, near the existing Hobart Substation off 
Hobart Street in Hingham.  The northern boundary of the Project Study Area is the MBTA 
railway and the southern boundary of the Project St udy Area is Lake Street (Whitmans 
Pond) in Weymouth and High Street in Hingham. 
The Project Study area includes primarily residenti al areas and commercial corridors. 
There are several wetlands resource areas and prote cted open space (land protected by 
Article 97) within the Project Study Area, including William A. Connell Swimming Pool and 
Skating Rink, Central Park, House Rock Park and Hof fman Park in Weymouth and 
Cranberry Pond Conservation area, Brewer Reservatio n and More-Brewer Park in 
Hingham. The Project Study Area includes the Weymouth Back River ACEC. 
4.4 Development of Routes 
After defining the Project Study Area, HMLP initial ly identified and conducted a screening 
assessment of the Universe of Routes, eliminating a ny routes that did not fully meet the 
routing objectives. HMLP considered existing linear  corridors (e.g., existing rail, electric 
ROWs and public roadway corridors) that appeared to be feasible to facilitate construction 
of the New Line and could provide a reasonably dire ct route between the Weymouth Tap 
Station and the Hobart II Substation.  Following th e screening process, the remaining 
routes were developed into complete and distinct Ca ndidate Routes for further 
investigation and scoring under a number of criteria.  The outcome of the routing analysis 
was the identification of the routes that best bala nce minimization of environmental 
impacts, constructability constraints and feasibili ty. Each of these steps in the routing 
analysis is discussed more fully below.  The routes were further analyzed based on costs, 
reliability, Environmental Justice considerations and feedback received from stakeholders.  
Candidate Routes were discussed with municipal stak eholders beginning in Spring 2021.  
As the route crossed through the Town of Weymouth, HMLP met with the Mayor and his 
staff initially on April 6, 2021 to discuss the Uni verse of Routes and Tap Station location.  
Weymouth officials provided input into the Universe  of Routes.  HMLP continued to meet 
with the Mayor and his staff throughout the routing analysis process.  See Table 4-1. 
4.4.1 Identification of Universe of Routes 
Using HMLP’s routing objectives and in consideration of stakeholder input (including from 
the public and Town of Weymouth and Town of Hingham  officials), HMLP reviewed USGS 
maps, MassGIS data and aerial photography and compl eted field reconnaissance to 
develop the Universe of Routes that could support a  new underground line between the 
proposed Weymouth tap station and a new substation in Hingham. The Universe of Routes 
is shown on Figure 4-4.  The Universe of Routes aim ed to compile the more direct routes 
between the two end points within the Project Study Area.  Table 4-4 provides an overview 
of the length, roads crossings and other features a long each route.  A summary of the 
Universe of Routes is presented below:

4.4.2 Screening Methodology 
The Universe of Routes identified by HMLP, with inp ut from stakeholders, consisted of 
seven different route options that were advanced fo r screening.  The initial screening 
process included reviewing publicly available data to consider existing abutting land uses 
and the presence of natural resources such as wetla nds, waterways and rare species 
habitat.  HMLP also reviewed the routes for constru ctability constraints, such as difficult 
bends or existing underground utility congestion. H MLP also considered information 
received from meetings with municipal officials and  staff.  Route options were eliminated 
from further consideration if they were found to be  unsuitable for transmission line 
development. 
4.4.2.1 Summary of Eliminated Routes 
The MBTA ROW and MBTA ROW variation were screened as part of the universe of routes. 
The majority of the MBTA Route is within the MBTA R OW and is a major public 
transportation route for commuters. The ROW also includes overhead electric transmission 
lines that run parallel to the tracks within the RO W.  Space between the rails and the 
electric transmission line is limited and the major ity of the ROW is too narrow to support 
the Project’s required width for the duct bank cons truction.  As a result, the MBTA route 
and its variation were eliminated from further cons ideration because they could not 
support the Project objectives of providing reliabl e infrastructure in a timely and cost-
effective manner due to construction feasibility constraints.   
Considerations for constructability include the are a available for construction and 
installation of the duct bank and manholes.  Indust ry standard installation practice is to 
maintain a minimum of 18 inches of separation (vert ical and horizontal) from abutting 
utilities.  The trench width for a typical duct ban k is 5 feet wide.  It is anticipated that 
areas where typical open trench excavation will occ ur will require an approximately 11-
foot wide work space area. Manhole and splice vault  installations typically require an 
approximately 20-foot wide work area.   
The entirety of the MBTA ROW associated with the MB TA Routes is a major public 
transportation route for commuters to and from the Boston area.  Much of the ROW is 
narrow, and there is limited space between rails, o ther infrastructure associated with the 
railroad, and existing electric transmission infrastructure to support the Project’s required 
width for the duct bank construction. 
The project would not be able to meet the requirements of the MBTA Railroad Operations 
Directorate, dated August 2014, which provides spec ifications for siting and construction 
of utilities along the rail lines.  Construction wo uld be limited to hours when the T is not 
running (11PM to 5AM at best) when in close proximi ty to rail, which would be 
approximately two (2) miles of the MBTA routes.  Co nstruction equipment used for the 
project would be required to be brought into and removed from the site at the end of each 
construction period. For excavation longitudinally along the rail line, shoring would need 
to be installed prior to excavation.  The time cons traints and construction requirements 
would add months, if not years to the project.   
In addition, at some point the proposed transmission line would need to cross a rail line(s).    
The crossing would need to be within a casing, and there is not adequate space for jacking 
and receiving pits within the MBTA ROW.   The use o f the MBTA ROW is not feasible due 
to the lack of space needed for jacking and receivi ng pits and the lack of space for 
installation of required manholes.  For any manhole s installed within the MBTA ROW, 

--- PAGE 86 ---
Section 4 Routing Analysis Tighe&Bond 
 
 
Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project  
EFSB Petition 
 4-22 
access to manholes would be restricted, severely im pacting electrical system operations 
and maintenance.   
Based on the constructability, and electrical system operations and maintenance concerns 
outlined above, the MBTA routes were eliminated from further consideration. 
4.4.3 Identification of Candidate Routes 
HMLP considered the five remaining Candidate Routes  for detailed analysis and ranking, 
as described below and presented in Figure 4-5. All  Candidate Routes would travel 
underground in existing public roadways.  None of t he candidate routes cross state 
highways or MBTA corridors.  The five Candidate Routes are identified below. 
• Candidate Route: Broad Street 
• Candidate Route: Broad Street Variation 
• Candidate Route:  Commercial Street 
• Candidate Route: Lake Street 
• Candidate Route:  Lake Street Variation 
4.5 Analysis of Candidate Routes 
To identify and evaluate potential routes, HMLP next scored each of the Candidate Routes 
based on several criteria that compare the relative  levels of potential environmental, 
technical, and human built/developed impacts, and constructability constraints. 
The other two steps of the process to identify the best routes include a cost analysis and 
a reliability analysis. 
Section 4.5 presents details regarding the scoring analysis completed for the Candidate 
Routes.  Sections 4.6 and 4.7 present the cost anal ysis and the reliability analysis 
completed for the Candidate Routes, respectively. 
4.5.1 Criteria and Weight Assessment 
HMLP evaluated and compared the Candidate Routes using a set of 14 criteria.  The criteria 
were developed to reflect the defined routing objec tives, public feedback, and 
environmental and constructability factors.  The sc oring criteria were grouped into the 
following three subcategories: 
• Natural Environment Criteria compare existing condi tions of, and potential 
impacts to, the natural environment. 
• Technical Criteria compare route location and technical design factors that may 
add complexity to construction. 
• Built Environment Criteria compare existing conditions of, and potential impacts 
to, development and surrounding population. 
HMLP assigned the individual criteria weights based  upon an assessment of the potential 
for temporary and permanent impacts and to reflect stakeholder input (including both 
municipality and public feedback as documented from  the meetings identified in Table 4-
1).  The weighting scale ranges from 1 to 5, with 1  being the lowest weight and 5 being 

--- PAGE 87 ---
Section 4 Routing Analysis Tighe&Bond 
 
 
Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project  
EFSB Petition 
 4-23 
the highest weight (indicating greatest importance) that could be assigned to a particular 
criterion.  For the routing analysis, lower total weighted ratio scores are better ranked. 
The 14 criteria identified by HMLP to evaluate and compare each Candidate Route are 
outlined in Section 4.5.3. 
4.5.2 Criteria Evaluation Methods 
After identifying the criteria to assess each route and assigning weights for each criterion, 
HMLP completed a scoring evaluation for each Candidate Route. HMLP scored and ranked 
each Candidate Route to reflect its ease of constructability and its potential for impacts to 
the developed and natural environment.  After gathe ring data for each Candidate Route, 
HMLP assessed each criterion and identified the Can didate Route that had the largest 
number for that criterion.  All other routes were t hen compared against this number to 
arrive at a “ratio score” for each Candidate Route on a scale of 0 to 1. 
For example, if Candidate Route X had 5 trees to be  removed, Candidate Route Y had 10 
trees, and Candidate Route Z had 15 trees, the ratio scores would be calculated as shown 
in the following table. 
TABLE 4-5 
Criteria Evaluation Summary  
Candidate 
Route 
Number of 
Trees Ratio Score 
Candidate 
Route X 
5 5 ÷ 15 = 0.33 
Candidate 
Route Y 
10 10 ÷ 15 = 0.66 
Candidate 
Route Z 
15 15 ÷ 15 = 1.00 
The lowest ratio score would equate to the route with the lowest potential for impact.  For 
each criterion, the ratio score was then multiplied  by its assigned weight to produce a 
weighted score that scaled the criterion by its relative importance. 
The ratio and weighted scores for each criterion were added to arrive at “total ratio scores” 
and “total weighted scores.”  The total weighted sc ores were then sorted in order from 
low to high, to identify a given Candidate Route’s “rank.”  The lowest weighted score would 
equate to the lowest potential for impact with emphasis on certain criterion as previously 
described in this section.  The ranks developed in this routing analysis are based on the 
total weighted scores.

4.5.3 Natural Environment Criteria, Technical Criteria, and Built 
Environment Criteria Description 
Natural Environment Criteria 
Although the Project Study Area is located primaril y in an urban/suburban or built 
environment, there are natural resources including wetland resource areas.  Sources of 
information used to evaluate the natural resource environment criteria were existing map 
resources such as USGS topographic maps, MassGIS da tabases (“Bureau of Geographic 
Information”) and recent aerial photography. 
Five natural environmental criteria were included in the analysis:  
• Permanently Protected Open Space/ Potential Article 97 
• Public Shade Trees 
• Wetland Resources 
• Outstanding Resource Waters (“ORWs”) or Areas of Critical Environmental Concern 
(“ACEC”) 
• Potential for Subsurface Soil Contamination 
While these resources are present in the Project St udy Area and can be important 
differentiators in route selection if affected duri ng construction, the associated potential 
impacts will be limited.  Environmental resources in the area are shown in Figure 4-6. 
Permanently Protected Open Space and Potential Article 97 
Land defined as open space may be protected by Arti cle 97 of Amendments to the 
Massachusetts Constitution.  Article 97 requires, in part, that certain land or easements 
taken or acquired for natural resource purposes shall not be used for other purposes unless 
the Massachusetts Legislature approves the change by a two-thirds vote.  The ratio score 
for this criterion was calculated by dividing the total length of route segments adjacent to 
Article 97 lands along each Candidate Route by the greatest total length among all the 
Candidate Routes. 
  This criterion was assigned a weight of 4 (on a scale of 1 to 5). 
 
Public Shade Trees 
In consideration of the potential for cutting or af fecting shade trees along the Candidate 
Routes during the construction process, public shad e trees within the public way, as 
defined by G.L. c. 87, were counted along the Candi date Routes.  A field reconnaissance 
was conducted to count all trees within the public way along the route regardless of 
diameter at breast height or distance from proposed  trench.  The scoring ratio for this 
criterion was calculated based on the total number of shade trees counted for each 
Candidate Route divided by the highest number of sh ade trees found along all candidate 
routes.  This criterion was assigned a weight of 4.

Wetland Resource Areas, Buffer Zone Crossings and T idelands 
The evaluation of wetland resources incorporates ri ver crossings and wetland resource 
area crossings (including the Riverfront Area and B ordering Land Subject to Flooding 
(“BLSF”)).  The evaluation of the river crossing cr iterion involved reviewing MassGIS 
databases and conducting field reconnaissance to de termine the number of rivers or 
waterbodies each Candidate Route would cross.  In e valuating Candidate Routes, river 
crossing evaluations require consideration of cross ing methods, including open trenching 
and trenchless methods, as well as options for avai lable road bridge crossings.  The 
evaluation of wetland crossings involved reviewing MassGIS and conducting field 
reconnaissance to determine the number of state-regulated resource areas, as defined in 
the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act regulations (310 CMR 10.00 et seq. ), including 
Bordering Vegetated Wetland (“BVW”) and River Bank and their associated 100-foot 
buffers, BLSF (100-year floodplain) and 200-foot Riverfront Area, that the proposed route 
would cross.  The evaluation of Chapter 91 jurisdictional areas involved reviewing MassGIS 
data layers developed under G.L. c. 91.  Approximate Chapter 91 jurisdiction was obtained 
by using a combination of contemporary high water, historic high water and landlocked 
tidelands to form the landward and seaward boundaries of landlocked tidelands. The ratio 
score was calculated by dividing the total number o f wetland resource areas for each 
Candidate Route by the highest number of wetland re source areas found along all 
Candidate Routes.  This criterion was assigned a weight of 4. 
Outstanding Resource Waters or Areas of Critical Environmental Concern 
The evaluation of ORWs and ACECs includes water bod y crossings and qualified land 
crossings. ACECs are places in Massachusetts that r eceive special recognition because of 
the quality, uniqueness and significance of their n atural and cultural resources. These 
areas are designated by the state’s Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs.   ORWs 
are waters designated for protection under 314 CMR 4.06 and include Class A Public Water 
Supplies and their tributaries, certain wetlands an d other waters as determined by 
MassDEP based on their outstanding socio-economic, recreational, ecological and/or 
aesthetic values. This criterion was assigned a weight of 4. 
Potential to Encounter Subsurface Contamination 
Trench excavation in urban and built environment ar eas poses a potential to encounter 
contaminated soil and groundwater that can affect worker safety and requires special soil 
and water management and disposal procedures under federal and state hazardous material 
regulations.  Releases of oil and/or hazardous material to the environment are required to 
be reported to the Massachusetts Department of Envi ronmental Protection’s (“MassDEP”) 
Bureau of Waste Site Cleanup in accordance with G.L . Chapter 21E and procedures 
established in the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (“MCP”) (310 CMR 40.0000).  MassDEP 
categorizes Oil or Hazardous Material (“OHM”) sites  based on the level of contamination 
present and the level of remediation completed.  HMLP’s route evaluation considered several 
groups of OHM sites that may have the potential to affect the Project based on their current 
status. 
An online search of the MassDEP Waste Site List in combination with a review of MassGIS 
databases was performed to determine the potential for each Candidate Route to encounter 
subsurface contamination from historical releases or former land development practices.  The 
MassDEP online database was used to collect information on listed MassDEP sites within 500 
feet of the Candidate Routes with a release tracking number (“RTN”).

Sites included in the search are: Active Tier Classified Tier I and Tier II sites, Activity and 
Use Limitation (“AUL”) sites closed with ongoing ma intenance conditions, Utility Related 
Abatement Measure (“URAM”) sites and Class C temporary solution sites. 
The following define each site category: 
• Tier Classified Sites: The MassDEP Tier Classified OHM sites datalayer is a statewide 
point dataset containing the approximate location o f OHM sites that have been: 
(1) reported; and (2) Tier Classified under G.L. Chapter 21E and the MCP. Location 
types featured in this datalayer include the approximate center of a site, the center 
of a building on the property where the release occurred, the source of contamination, 
or the location of an on-site monitoring well.  Thi s datalayer does not include: (1) 
contaminated sites that have not been reported to MassDEP; or (2) sites for which a 
Response Action Outcome (“RAO”) has been submitted to MassDEP.  Tier Classified 
sites are broken down into Tier I and Tier II sites as follows: 
o Tier I: Any disposal site which meets the criteria under 310 CMR 40.0520(2) 
at the time of Tier Classification 
o Tier II: Any disposal site which meets the criteria under 310 CMR 40.0520(4) 
at the time of Tier Classification. 
• AUL : The MassDEP OHM sites with AUL datalayer is a sta tewide point dataset 
containing the approximate location of OHM sites where an AUL has been filed.  An 
AUL provides notice of the presence of oil and/or hazardous material contamination 
remaining at the location after a cleanup has been conducted pursuant to Chapter 
21E and the MCP.  The AUL is a legal document that identifies activities and uses of 
the property that may and may not occur, as well as the property owner’s obligation 
and maintenance conditions that must be followed to  ensure the safe use of the 
property.  Location types featured in this data layer include the approximate center 
of an AUL site, the center of a building on the property where the release occurred, 
the approximate center of the lot and source of contamination. 
• Class C RAO/Temporary Solution : These are sites where there has been a temporary 
cleanup.  Although the site does not present a “substantial hazard,” it has not reached 
a level of no significant risk.  The site must be evaluated every five years until such 
time that a Permanent Solution Statement is submitted. 
• URAM:  Sites subject to utility related abatement measures.  
Each Candidate Route was assessed with regard to the number of these active sites located 
on property parcels within 500 feet of the Candidate Route.  The raw scores for this criterion 
were determined based on the total number of these mapped active sites and the ratio score 
was calculated by dividing the total found for each individual route by the highest number of 
these sites found along the five Candidate Routes.  This criterion was assigned a weight of 
3. 
Technical Criteria 
Sources of information used to evaluate design/cons truction criteria included recent 
aerial photography, field reconnaissance, and engineering and construction expertise.  In 
general, narrow roads can contribute to unavailable or tight space for the proposed pipe 
trench and manholes, which can constrict constructi on and increase open-trench and 
manhole excavation durations and traffic disruption s with lane and road closures.  The 
number of turns or bends required for a route can s ignificantly affect design and

construction, especially in complex road intersecti ons with dense underground utilities, 
causing delays and increasing costs as well as the possibility of requiring new property 
acquisitions.  Requirements for installing the infr astructure using trenchless technology 
such as horizontal directional drilling (“HDD”) can significantly impact cost and schedule.  
Four criteria were established to assess design and  construction opportunities and 
constraints when evaluating the Candidate Routes, as follows:  
• Existing Road and Right of Way Width 
• Existing Utility Density 
• Hard Angles 
• High Impact Crossings 
Existing Road/ROW Width 
The existing roadway width determines the available  workspace above grade to perform 
the primary construction activities (i.e., divert t raffic, set up equipment, excavate trench 
and manhole areas, install pipe, backfill the trench and restore paving).  A narrow roadway 
width of less than or equal to 30 feet generally has a greater probability of affecting traffic 
flow due to reduced lane widths and/or full closure  of one or both lanes in the roadway.  
Road widths were estimated along the Candidate Rout es by road-segment length using 
MassGIS maps and field reconnaissance.   
The linear lengths of narrow road segments were recorded.  The ratio score was calculated 
by dividing the total length of narrow road segment determined for each Candidate Route 
by the highest total length of all candidate routes .  This criterion was assigned a weight 
of 4. 
Existing Utility Density 
The number of existing underground pipelines, utili ty conduits and related features such 
as manholes and catch basins, and the depth of these facilities in the roadway, affect the 
available space below grade to physically install t he proposed transmission conduits and 
manhole system. Extensive utility density can signi ficantly constrain available space, 
complicate the construction process, and increase construction duration, traffic disruption 
and costs.  Utility density was assessed along cand idate routes using data compiled from 
available records as provided by utility companies, including HMLP and National Grid, the 
Town of Weymouth GIS data, and Google Earth, and we re up-to-date as of June 2021.  
Utility density was only assessed horizontally, as vertical data was not available at the 
time of analysis.  The score for Existing Utility D ensity was calculated based on the 
following criteria: Usable Corridor Width, Utility Crossings and Heat Generating Sources.  
Useable Corridor Width assessed the maximum availab le underground space horizontally 
within each Candidate Route.  Utility Crossings inc lude utilities that perpendicularly 
intersect each Candidate Route, regardless of type,  size or depth.  Heat Generating 
Sources include electric utilities perpendicularly intersecting each Candidate Route, 
regardless of size or depth.  The route options were first separately scored for each of the 
three criteria.  A weighted ratio was then assigned  to the calculated score based on its 
relative significance to the overall estimate of ut ility density.  The weighted scores for all 
factors were then added up for each route to develo p a single “utility density” score for 
the route.  This criterion was assigned a weight of 5.

Hard Angles 
Hard Angles were estimated along Candidate Routes a nd were defined as a turn in the 
route that exceeds 30 degrees. Additionally, an S c urve, or two immediate turns in the 
route are included in this category. This criterion was assigned a weight of 4. 
High Impact Crossings 
High impact crossings are the more significant tran sportation corridor crossings where, 
because of the amount of traffic and traffic patter ns, greater consideration of alternative 
construction methods such as HDD is warranted.  Hig h impact crossings were defined as 
a Candidate Route crossing over or under a bridge, railroad or highway.  This includes 
trenchless crossing methods where the traditional o pen-cut trench method is infeasible 
(e.g., at crossings of water bodies or under highwa ys and railroads) so alternative 
methods such as jack-and-bore or horizontal directi onal drilling are required.  The ratio 
score for this criterion was calculated based on th e total length of high impact crossings 
found along each individual route divided by the hi ghest length of high impact crossings 
found along the five Candidate Routes.  This criterion was assigned a weight of 5. 
Built Environment Criteria 
Built environment criteria compare existing conditi ons of, and potential impacts to, the 
developed environment and surrounding population.  The five built environment criteria 
included in the scoring analysis are: 
• Adjacent Land Uses - Residential  
• Adjacent Land Uses – Commercial and Industrial 
• Sensitive Receptors 
• Historic and Archaeological Resources 
• Traffic Impacts 
Sources of information used in the built environmen t criteria evaluations were existing 
map resources (i.e., MassGIS, USGS topographic maps and aerial photography), technical 
expertise and field reconnaissance.  The built envi ronment land uses described in the 
following paragraphs, including residential, commer cial and industrial land uses, and 
public transportation routes and facilities. 
Land uses (residential, commercial/industrial) in t he vicinity of the Candidate Routes are 
shown in Figure 4-7.  Cultural resources are shown in Figure 4-8.

Adjacent Land Uses - Residential 
Residents along a Candidate Route could be subject to temporary access and traffic 
disruption, street closings, sound level increases and dust during construction.  This 
criterion assesses the density of residences (singl e-family, multi-family, condominiums 
and mixed commercial and residential) on both sides  of roadways along each route.  The 
number of residential structures along street segme nts was counted using MassGIS 
mapping, parcel data, Google Street View imagery, a erial photography and field 
verification.  The “unit” attribute information inc luded in the parcel layer was used to 
assign a unit count to each identified residential structure.  Internet searches were used 
to find or verify unit counts for some large multip le unit apartment or condominium 
complexes (such as the Tammy Brook Apartments on King Avenue in Weymouth).  Parcel 
and building information changes continually so there is an inherent degree of time-based 
inaccuracy in addition to any data creation or data  entry errors already present in the 
source data.  A ratio score was calculated based on  the total number of individual 
residences determined for each route divided by the  highest number of residences found 
along the five Candidate Routes. This criterion was assigned a weight of 5. 
Adjacent Land Uses – Commercial and Industrial 
Similar to residences, commercial and industrial businesses along a Candidate Route could 
be affected by temporary construction impacts such as access and traffic disruption, street 
closings, sound level increases and potential dust.   This criterion assessed the density of 
commercial and industrial businesses along each rou te by counting the number of 
buildings adjacent to the route roadway.  The numbe r of commercial/industrial buildings 
along the route were counted using MassGIS mapping,  parcel data, aerial photography, 
Google Street View imagery and/or field verificatio n to determine the number of units 
along each route.  The ratio score for this criteri on was determined based on the total 
number of individual commercial/industrial building  units determined for each route 
divided by the highest number of commercial/industr ial building units found along the 
Candidate Routes.  This criterion was assigned a weight of 4. 
Sensitive Receptors 
Sensitive receptors could be affected by temporary construction impacts such as access 
and traffic disruption, road closings, sound level increases and potential dust.  The number 
of sensitive receptors along the route were counted  using MassGIS databases, aerial 
photography, Internet searches, Google Street View and field verification.  Consistent with 
similar filings to the EFSB, the following sensitiv e receptors were assessed for each 
Candidate Route: police and fire stations, hospital s, schools, nursing homes/elder care 
(long term care), funeral homes, places of worship, daycares, and parks and recreational 
facilities.  Police and fire stations, hospitals, s chools, long-term care and parks and 
recreation facilities were determined using applicable MassGIS datalayers.  Funeral homes 
and places of worship were identified using the lat est available aerial imagery, internet 
searches and Google Street View.  Daycare facilitie s were identified using the 
Massachusetts Early Education Search tool available  through the Executive Office of 
Education’s website.  A ratio score was calculated based on the total number of sensitive 
receptors determined for each route divided by the highest number of sensitive receptors 
found along the Candidate Routes.   This criterion was assigned a weight of 5.

Historic and Archeological Resources 
Historic and archeological resources could be affected by temporary construction impacts 
such as access and traffic disruption, earth moveme nt, street closings, sound level 
increases and dust.  Historical inventory was evalu ated using the Massachusetts Cultural 
Resources Inventory System (“MACRIS”) MassGIS datal ayer maintained by the 
Massachusetts Historical Commission (“MHC”).   This  data includes local and state listed 
historic structures, local historic districts and individual National Register-listed structures 
and districts. 
The number of cultural resources was derived from t he total number of historic sites and 
the number of historic districts or areas along each Candidate Route. MHC Inventory points 
were tallied within parcels that were directly adja cent to the property boundary of the 
public roadways along each Candidate Route.  MHC In ventory Areas were quantified by 
tallying parcels within each area that are directly adjacent to the property boundary of the 
public roadway along each Candidate Route, excluding parcels that also contained historic 
sites, to avoid double counting.  The ratio score w as calculated by dividing the total 
number of cultural resources determined for each Candidate Route by the highest number 
of cultural resources found among all the Candidate  Routes.  This criterion was assigned 
a weight of 1. 
Traffic Impacts 
The potential for in-street trench construction to cause traffic related congestion was 
evaluated for each Candidate Route.  The evaluation  was based on information obtained 
from MassGIS, aerial photography, relevant traffic and signal data from municipal 
agencies, field reconnaissance and familiarity and experience with the traffic flow and 
operations in the general area. 
Impacts can be caused by several factors, some of which can be anticipated and quantified 
(such as the effect of reducing travel lanes, eliminating a bus stop or closure of a sidewalk) 
and some factors that are temporary/unanticipated, such as weather conditions, crashes, 
other construction activity/detours in the area, an d congestion on other area highways 
and routes that may reroute regional traffic onto local roadways.  The analysis provides a 
relative comparison of the different routes using f actors that are directly attributable to 
the congestion that could be caused by the construc tion activity.  Presenting the review 
in the form of a relative comparison between routes using only pertinent factors removes 
the effect of temporary/unanticipated factors from the route selection process.  
Specifically, the typical multi-modal factors that were used in the review include functional 
classification of the roadways, publicly-available roadway and intersection traffic volumes, 
roadway cross-sectional elements (such as width, nu mber of travel lanes, on-street 
parking, shoulders, sidewalks and the types of uses they serve), bus routes and ridership 
data from the MBTA, the number of major and minor traffic signals along the route, need 
to maintain loading/unloading areas for business de liveries and whether construction on 
a roadway segment would cause just lane closures or  require detours via other streets. 
HMLP collected information from sources including t he MBTA and MassDOT – Highway 
Division, and conducted field reconnaissance along each route to observe the general 
conditions along the routes.  This information was evaluated to determine the potential 
for traffic congestion and parking and public trans portation impacts for each route.  Key 
factors considered included existing traffic volume s (where available), classification of 
major commuting routes, roadway width, number of tr avel lanes, existence of parking 
lanes and the presence of public transportation (bu s routes or MBTA railway stations).  
More specifically, the following criteria, and assu mptions behind them, represent the 

--- PAGE 99 ---
Section 4 Routing Analysis Tighe&Bond 
 
 
Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project  
EFSB Petition 
 4-35 
factors HMLP used to evaluate the potential for tra ffic and other transportation impacts 
during construction: 
• Number of lanes: Roadways with multiple lanes (in each direction) are more likely 
to support construction without road closures, and are more likely to support 
“normal” traffic flow.  Single lane roads are more likely to require a lane closure 
and alternating traffic, which leads to congestion.  Roadways with single lanes 
received a higher impact score than multiple lane r oadways due to the potential 
need for full roadway closures and detours during c onstruction.  For this project, 
none of the roadways have multiple lanes. 
• Number of signalized intersections:  Routes that tr avel through more signalized 
intersections than others can lead to more potential traffic impacts due to the need 
to address additional construction issues related to temporary signal modifications 
and the increased congestion that would result from  the reduction of capacity at 
signalized locations.  For example, the Broad Stree t route received a higher score 
in this category than a route with fewer signalized intersections. 
• Sidewalks, Breakdown Lanes, Roadside Parking: The i mpact to on-street parking, 
pedestrian facilities, and loading areas was considered in the scoring system.   Most 
roadways along the routes have sidewalks and some h ave parking lanes.  Those 
routes with higher pedestrian activity, parking man euvers, and curbside loading 
activity received a higher score due to a larger impact on more pedestrians, parking 
and commercial loading demand.  For example, Broad Street is a busy commercial 
corridor with a lot of pedestrian activity and on-street parking demand.  Therefore, 
it was assigned a higher score for this category th an side streets with less 
pedestrian and parking activity. 
• One-Way Streets: Streets that have one-way traffic flow require closures and 
detours and will therefore have a greater impact on  traffic congestion than lane 
shifts on two-way streets.  One-way streets are mor e likely to require closures or 
detours due to the overall width and the inability to reverse travel patterns.  
Roadways that require closures or detours received higher impacts scores than 
those that may only require a lane-shift or can rem ain open with the closure of a 
single lane.  For this project, all Candidate Routes are located on two-way streets. 
• Public Transportation Routes: Streets with public t ransportation features (bus 
stops/routes, train stops) require additional effort to avoid impacting mass transit 
and can require temporary relocation of stops.  Thi s affects additional areas of 
roadway with no benefit to Project construction, an d was assumed to exacerbate 
traffic congestion due to disruption of normal traffic patterns.  Routes that contain 
bus routes and have more bus stops than others rece ived a higher impact score.  
There will be a need to address pedestrian access a nd the temporary location of 
bus stops.  There will also be an impact on travel times for buses that travel on 
any of the proposed construction routes.  For examp le, Broad Street contains 
numerous bus stops and MBTA Bus Routes and received a higher score than those 
roadways that do not have any public transportation routes. 
• Commuter Routes: Routes used by commuters were assumed to be more likely to 
be affected by Project construction due to high traffic volumes during morning and 
evening commute hours, and often around mid-day (lu nch time).  Commuter 
routes were designated based on direct observation,  general knowledge of the 
area, and input from the municipality.  Traffic volumes related to busier commuter 
routes are a factor in determining the overall impa ct score.  Routes with higher 

--- PAGE 100 ---
Section 4 Routing Analysis Tighe&Bond 
 
 
Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project  
EFSB Petition 
 4-36 
traffic volumes were assigned a higher impact score , as more drivers will be 
affected and there will be more delay and congestion experienced by more people.  
For example, Commercial Street is a heavily used commuter route with high traffic 
volumes and had a higher impact score in this categ ory than the low-volume side 
streets. 
The route options were first separately scored for each of the review factors.  A weighted 
ratio was then assigned to the calculated factor score based on its relative significance to 
the overall estimate of congestion potential.  The weighted scores for all factors were then 
added up for each route to develop a single transpo rtation impacts score for the route.  
This criterion was given a weight of 4.

Table 4-8 presents a summary of the Candidate Routes ranked by total weighted score.  
The lowest total weighted score equates to the lowest potential for impact, with the 
emphasis on certain criteria as previously described in this section. 
 
TABLE 4-8 
Rank by Total Weighted Scores 
 
Candidate Route Route Length (miles) Total Weighted S core Rank 
Broad Street 3.2 40.5 2 
Broad Street Variation 3.1 44.3 5 
Commercial Street 4.3 42.5 4 
Lake Street 3.7 40.2 1 
Lake Street Variation 3.6 41.5 3 
As shown in Tables 4-7 and 4-8, the Lake Street Candidate Route has the lowest weighted 
score and would result in the lowest potential for impact of all the Candidate Routes 
evaluated.  The Broad Street Candidate Route has th e next lowest potential for impact.  
As the Weymouth Conservation Agent and Herring Run Warden requested HMLP to look 
at a variation of the Lake Street route near Water Street, HMLP carried both Lake Street 
Candidate Routes forward. 
4.6 Cost Analysis 
HMLP evaluated the order of magnitude cost estimate s for total costs for each Candidate 
Route in order to rank the various Candidate Routes. 
Many factors could affect the actual cost of a transmission line project, including cost and 
availability of materials and equipment, labor, the presence of contaminated soils and the 
potential for work hour restrictions imposed by the  local community or other entities.  
Subsurface conditions such as the type and depth of soil and rock that must be excavated 
in order to place the duct bank could also significantly affect project cost.  In addition, the 
cost is influenced by the density of underground utilities. 
A summary of the order of magnitude cost estimates is provided below in Table 4-9.  Broad 
Street Variation has the lowest projected cost over all.  The next lowest projected 
Candidate Route cost is Broad Street.

1 Cost per mile for the transmission line is $14.7 M; As the Tap Station costs and Substation 
costs are the same for each route, only the transmission line costs were compared.  
4.7 Reliability Analysis 
HMLP considered whether there was a difference in t he Candidate Routes with regard to 
reliability.  All Candidate Routes are underground and have relatively small differences in 
design that would not result in any substantial difference in the level of reliability risk.   
4.8 Selection of Preferred and Noticed Alternative 
Routes

HMLP balanced considerations of environmental impacts, reliability and costs in identifying 
routes to meet the identified need of the Project.  Substantial feedback has been provided 
to HMLP from various agencies reflecting more detai led nuances in route selection that 
are further articulated in Section 5. 
The Lake Street Route has the lowest overall scorin g rank with the Broad Street Route 
being closely ranked with the second lowest overall  score.  HMLP had extensive 
consultations with Town of Weymouth and Town of Hin gham officials and held multiple 
open houses during the routing analysis.  Town of W eymouth officials indicated that the 
timing of the projects is important, as there are p lans to construct street improvements 
along Lake Street prior to the construction of the proposed Transmission Line.  In addition, 
there are more residences along Lake Street, includ ing Environmental Justice housing 
units directly adjacent to the Lake Street Routes.  Regarding the Broad Street route, there 
is proposed redevelopment within Jackson Square.  I nput received from open houses 
indicates a concern along the Broad Street Route for impacts to traffic along Broad Street 
during construction.  As the two routes ranked very close in score, the Broad Street Route 
is the Preferred Route and the Lake Street Route is  the Noticed Alternative Route and 
advanced for further analysis in Section 5.   As th e Weymouth Conservation Agent and 
Herring Run Warden requested HMLP to look at a vari ation of the Lake Street route near 
Water Street, HMLP carried both Lake Street Candidate Routes forward.  While the Broad 
Street Route is the Preferred Route, HMLP is prepar ed to move forward with either the 
Broad Street Route or the Lake Street Route (or its variation).  
The Preferred Route and Noticed Alternative Route are shown in Figure 4-9. 
4.9 Conclusion 
In accordance with the Siting Board’s standard of r eview, after employing a 
comprehensive process to select sites for its substation in Hingham and the tap station in 
Weymouth, HMLP objectively and comprehensively deve loped and assessed a wide array 
of potential routes and design variations within th e bounds of the Project Study Area.  At 
the conclusion of this process, HMLP identified a Preferred Route and a Noticed Alternative 
Route that best balance impacts, constructability and costs and enable HMLP to meet the 
identified need. 
A more detailed examination and comparison of the P referred Route and Noticed 
Alternative Route is presented in Section 5 of this Analysis.

Section 5     
Comparison of Preferred and Noticed 
Alternative Routes and Ancillary Facilities 
This section provides a detailed analysis and compa rison of the potential environmental 
impacts and mitigation measures, costs and reliability of the Preferred Route and Noticed 
Alternative Route for the Project.  The potential for environmental impacts associated with 
the proposed Weymouth Tap Station and proposed Hoba rt II Substation in Hingham is 
also provided. 
5.1 Route Descriptions 
Descriptions of the Preferred Route and the Noticed Alternative Route are provided below. 
5.1.1 Preferred Route 
The total length of the Preferred Route, the Broad Street Route, is approximately 17,100 
linear feet (about 3.2 miles) of which approximatel y 11,040 linear feet (2.1 miles) are in 
Weymouth and approximately 6,100 linear feet (1.1 m iles) are in Hingham. This route  
exits the proposed Hobart II Substation in Hingham and runs west on Hobart Street, turns 
south on French Street, then turns west on High Street and continues west into Weymouth 
on High Street which becomes Broad Street. Broad St reet is followed for approximately 
8,500 feet until ending at the Weymouth Tap Station Site at the Eversource Right-of-Way. 
The segments of the route within Hingham are identi cal for the Preferred Route and 
Noticed Alternative Route. 
The Broad Street Route crosses Herring Run Brook an d is in the vicinity of several major 
conservation areas, including the Ridgewood Crossin g Conservation Area. Existing road 
widths range from 25 feet (French and Hobart Street ) to 40 feet (Broad Street), with a 
medium existing utility density.  There are eightee n MBTA bus stops along the MBTA Bus 
Route 222 which follows portions of Broad Street and High Street. 
The predominant adjacent land use is residential, w ith some commercial and industrial 
uses, one school, three places of worship, and park s and recreation facilities including 
Robert S. Hoffman Park and Connell Rink and Pool.  Wetland resources in the vicinity of 
the Preferred Route include the 100-year floodplain , and Herring Run Brook.  This route 
also crosses a portion of the Weymouth Back River A CEC.  Work within wetland resource 
areas is within developed and previously disturbed areas.  There are two known sites with 
potential to encounter subsurface contamination near the Preferred Route. 
Representative photographs taken in 2024 of existing conditions along the Preferred Route 
and an overview map showing the photograph locations are provided in Appendix 5-1.  A 
description of existing environmental and cultural (historic and archeological) resources 
and adjacent land uses along the Preferred Route are provided in Section 5.4 and depicted 
in Figures 5-1, 5-2, and 5-3 using aerial photograp hy and data layers available from 
MassGIS and field reconnaissance.

Section 5 Comparison of Preferred and Noticed Alternative Routes Tighe&Bond 
 
 
Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project  
EFSB Petition 
 5-5
5.1.2 Noticed Alternative Route 
The total length of the Noticed Alternative Route, the Lake Street Route, is approximately 
19,600 linear feet (3.7 miles) of which approximately 13,500 linear feet (2.6 miles) are in 
Weymouth and approximately 6,100 linear feet (1.1 m iles) are in Hingham.  This route 
exits the proposed Hobart II Substation in Hingham and runs west on Hobart Street, then 
turns south on French Street and turns west on High Street. The route continues west into 
Weymouth continuing on High Street which becomes Broad Street.  This route then turns 
south down Water Street, turning north on Pleasant Street, and travels west on Lake 
Street, and northwest on Essex Street, which transitions to Spring Street.  The route turns 
west onto Broad Street and continues west on Broad Street to the Weymouth Tap Station 
site on Eversource’s Right-of-Way.  The Noticed Alternative Route is a combination of main 
and side streets and is relatively direct.   
As the Lake Street Route runs parallel to Herring Run, the Weymouth Conservation Agent 
and Herring Run Warden requested that HMLP consider  a variation to the Noticed 
Alternative Route to avoid Water Street.  HMLP added a variation to the Noticed Alternative 
Route to follow Shawmut Street to Broad Street.  Th is variation is also included in the 
assessment.  
The predominant adjacent land use is residential, w ith some commercial and industrial 
uses and one school and one place of worship.  The Noticed Alternative Route crosses 
Herring Run Brook. There are two known sites along the Noticed Alternative Route that 
have potential for subsurface contamination. Protec ted open space is present along the 
route, including More-Brewer Park and Humphrey Field. 
The Noticed Alternative Route runs adjacent to Whit mans Pond, which is listed as an 
emergency surface water supply.  This route also crosses a portion of the Weymouth Back 
River ACEC.  The road widths range from 20 feet (Sh awmut Street) to 40 feet (Broad 
Street. There are eleven MBTA bus stops along the Noticed Alternative Route. The overall 
existing utility density of the Lake Street route is slightly higher than the Preferred Route, 
having a medium-high density. 
Representative photographs taken in 2024 of existin g conditions along the Noticed 
Alternative Route and an overview map showing the photograph locations are provided as 
Appendix 5-1. A description of existing environment al and cultural (historic and 
archeological) resources and adjacent land uses alo ng the Noticed Alternative Route is 
provided in Section 5.4 and depicted in Figures 5-4, 5-5, and 5-6 using aerial photography 
and data layers available from MassGIS and field reconnaissance.

Potential Environmental Impacts at Weymouth Tap Station 
Land Use 
The proposed Weymouth Tap Station is located on an approximately 11.6-acre 
Eversource-owned parcel of land.  The parcel landsc ape consists of various sloping 
topography and areas of exposed surficial ledge.  An Eversource transmission ROW, which 
currently includes two transmission lines and acces s roads, occupies approximately half 
of the site.  The vegetation within this ROW is maintained in compliance with Eversource’s 
Transmission Vegetation Management Plan.  The remai nder of the site is populated with 
a mixed hardwood forest.  The Tap Station Site is b ordered by Eversource transmission 
ROW, the Connell Memorial Rink and Pool, residences, undeveloped land owned by NGrid 
and Broad Street.  The total area of land disturban ce associated with the Tap Station 
would be approximately 2.5 acres.  Nearby land uses  are predominantly single-family 
residential, with some industrial and recreational uses.  A church, Crossroads Worship 
Center, is located southeast of the site, across Broad Street. 
The ROW will continue to be used for electric transmission purposes.  Upon completion of 
construction, the site not otherwise used for the Tap Station and associated appurtenances 
will be restored by stabilizing disturbed soils and  landscaped in a manner appropriate to 
the surroundings/neighborhood. 
Wetland Resource Areas 
The proposed Weymouth Tap Station is located within  an existing transmission corridor.  
Wetland resource areas were delineated on August 2,  2022.  Wetland boundaries were 
established in accordance with the provisions of th e Massachusetts Wetlands Protection 
Act, the Weymouth Wetlands Protection Ordinance (Ch apter 7, Section 301, Weymouth 
Code of Ordinances) and its implementing regulations, and the United States Army Corps 
of Engineers methodology based on the plant communi ty, soils, hydrology, and other 
contributing factors, including topography.  There is an unnamed waterway located to the 
north and east of the site that is shown as perenni al on the latest USGS map.   BVW was 
delineated adjacent to the unnamed waterway.   The Tap Station site is primarily forested, 
and vegetation removal will be required prior to gr ading of the site.   Vegetation removal 
is proposed within the outer 100-foot Buffer Zone t o the BVW and the outer 200-foot 
Riverfront Area to the unnamed waterway.  The propo sed vegetation removal within the 
Riverfront Area is limited to 4,000 sf of impact.  This impact is unavoidable to provide for 
a safe and secure perimeter to the Tap Station faci lity.  In the Riverfront Area, selective 
tree trimming and removal will occur to meet safety and security standards and minimize 
disturbance to the resource area.  A Notice of Inte nt will be filed with the Weymouth 
Conservation Commission requesting an Order of Conditions for this work. 
Flood Zones 
Based on the National Flood Insurance Rate Map, Panel 229, Map Number 25021C0229E, 
revised July 17, 2012, and the National Flood Insurance Rate Map, Panel 227, Map Number 
25021C0227F, revised June 9, 2014, the Tap Station Site is not located within a 
designated Flood Zone.  Construction and operation of the Tap Station would not be 
expected to exacerbate local flooding as on-site stormwater management systems will be 
installed to control stormwater runoff from new impervious surfaces on-site.   
Stormwater Management 
A stormwater management system will be developed to  treat both the quality and the 
quantity of stormwater discharge from the site.  Th e stormwater BMPs will include a 
sediment forebay and stormwater basin to address peak runoff from the Tap Station site.

Visual Impacts 
The proposed Tap Station will be located along the central-eastern portion of the property.  
The Tap Station will be visible from the adjacent C onnell Memorial Rink and Pool and its 
access road, with the access road partially located in the existing Eversource transmission 
ROW.  The Tap Station includes a structure to house  electrical control and relay panels 
and AIS.  The tallest structures within the Tap Station site are four (4) lightning masts at 
85 feet each.  The Tap Station will be surrounded by a 10-foot-tall chain link fence.  Three 
poles are proposed on the ROW adjacent to the transmission lines for the tap.  These new 
poles will be consistent with the existing infrastr ucture within the ROW.  The Tap Station 
equipment is proposed to be set back approximately 550 feet from Broad Street, so visual 
impacts along Broad Street will be limited.  The cl osest residence to the Tap Station is 
approximately 405 feet and visual impacts to this residence (and other nearby residences) 
is expected to be minimal as the Tap Station is on the opposite side of the transmission 
ROW from the residence.  As mentioned above, Everso urce will provide landscaping and 
other visual mitigation and screening adjacent to t he Tap Station to minimize visual 
impacts.   
Noise 
Work to construct the Tap Station will take place over an approximately 24-month period. 
Construction activities will include site preparati on, including rock removal and grading, 
and the installation of new poles, electrical equip ment, support structures and 
foundations.  During this time, nearby residences may be affected by temporary elevated 
noise levels associated with a typical construction site.  Construction will comply with the 
MassDEP regulations related to noise.  To further m itigate construction noise at nearby 
residences, Eversource plans to: 
• Require well-maintained equipment with functioning mufflers; 
• Require strict compliance with MassDEP’s Anti-Equipment Idling regulations; 
• Operate stationary noise generating equipment away from nearby residences; and 
• Work with the Town to schedule construction outside these hours where necessary. 
HMLP and Eversource anticipate that these measures will appropriately minimize 
construction-related noise impacts in the areas nea r the Tap Station site.  As no 
transformer is proposed at the Tap Station, no operational noise is anticipated. 
Daytime and nighttime noise impacts from the propos ed Project and anticipated 
equipment installations are predicted to fully comp ly with the applicable MassDEP noise 
policy. 
Traffic 
The proposed Tap Station is located off public road s, and traffic impacts associated with 
Tap Station construction are expected to be minor a nd temporary in nature.  Access to 
the Tap Station site will be through the existing a ccess road off of Broad Street, onto the 
gravel access road that runs parallel to the transm ission lines in the Eversource ROW as 
well as through a new access road off of the Connel l Memorial Rink and Pool driveway, 
which is on Eversource property.  Eversource will c oordinate construction activities with 
the adjacent Connell Memorial Rink and Pool so as t o minimize impact on the facility 
operations.   
After construction, the Project will not generate additional traffic.  The Tap Station will not 
be a manned facility and Eversource staff will acce ss the Tap Station as needed.  No 
significant vehicular traffic is anticipated.

Public Shade Trees 
The proposed construction of the Weymouth Tap Station is not anticipated to affect public 
shade trees.  The portion of the site where the Tap Station is proposed is currently forested 
and will require removal of trees within the work area.   Approximately 221 trees 6 inches 
or greater diameter at breast height (“dbh”) will b e removed at the Tap Station site.  
Eversource will provide landscaping and other visual mitigation and screening adjacent to 
the Tap Station to minimize visual impacts.  Everso urce will have preliminary 
conversations with Weymouth officials, abutters and community members regarding such 
landscaping and will evaluate input as the final landscaping plan is designed.  
Potential to Encounter Subsurface Contamination 
Per MassDEP’s Waste Site & Reportable Releases site  look-up tool, there are no releases 
reported at the Tap Station site.   
Air Quality 
The potential for fugitive dust and for emissions f rom equipment associated with 
construction activities at the Weymouth Tap Station  will be mitigated as described in 
Section 5.4.3. 
Electric and Magnetic Fields 
The term “electric and magnetic fields” (“EMF”) is used to describe fields created by electric 
voltage (electric fields) and electric current (mag netic fields).  An electric field is present 
whenever voltage exists on an object and is not dep endent on current.  Similarly, a 
magnetic field is present whenever current flows in  a conductor and is not dependent on 
voltage.  When an object has voltage and carries current, it produces both an electric and 
magnetic field. HMLP, like all North American elect ric utilities, supplies electricity at 60 
Hertz (“Hz”) (60 cycles per second).  Therefore, th e electric utility system, and the 
equipment connected to it, produce 60-Hz (power-frequency) EMF. 
Gradient Corporation performed an independent EMF assessment covering all elements of 
the proposed underground 115kV project, including t he proposed Hobart II Substation 
and Weymouth Tap Station.  AIS is to be used at the  new Tap Station; MFs will diminish 
rapidly with distance from the tap station equipment and the Tap Station will not abut any 
residential properties (note that the closest resid ential properties on Broad Street, over 
400 feet away, are in closer proximity to the Proje ct’s underground 115kV transmission 
line than the Tap Station), and the Project underground line would thus be expected to be 
a larger potential source of MFs at these propertie s than the more distant Tap Station.  
The closest residences on Roosevelt Road are on the  other side of the Eversource ROW 
from the Tap Station, so the Tap Station would be e xpected to be a negligible source of 
MFs at these properties.  In addition, engineering design diagrams indicate that the closest 
switchgear to the paved parking lot at the Connell Rink and Pool is to be located more 
than 50 feet from the parking lot edge, such that MFs from the tap station equipment will 
have diminished to minimal levels.  It is well esta blished that, for the types of electrical 
equipment present in the proposed Tap Station (e.g., aboveground buswork, switchgear), 
where conductors are arranged in close proximity to each other, that EMF levels decrease 
rapidly to low levels inside the fence line; and the strongest fields near the perimeter fence 
are expected to be associated with the transmission and distribution lines entering/exiting 
the station (IEEE, 2014).  As a result, it is expec ted that MFs outside the fence lines of 
the new Tap Station will be dominated by MFs associ ated with the Project underground 
115kV transmission line and other transmission or d istribution lines entering/exiting the 
stations rather than equipment within the fence lines.

ACECs and ORWs 
There are no ACECs or ORWs in proximity to the Tap Station Site. 
Cultural Resources 
Based on review of available records, no inventorie d archaeological sites or historic 
properties on the Federal or State Register of Hist oric Places or the Massachusetts 
Historical Commission’s Inventory of the Historic a nd Archaeological Assets of the 
Commonwealth are located on the Tap Station Site.  As there are sites in proximity, the 
Petitioners are coordinating with the MHC to conduc t field investigations on previously 
undeveloped portions of the site and will continue to coordinate with MHC on the results 
of this investigation.    No impact to any historic or archaeological feature is anticipated in 
association with Tap Station construction or operation.        
5.3 Hobart II Substation 
A new substation is proposed at the Hingham Transfe r Station site, which is a 9.7-acre 
property owned by the Town of Hingham and located o ff Old Hobart Street in Hingham.  
The substation is proposed on an approximately ½ ac re area of undeveloped land at the 
northeastern corner of the transfer station parcel,  adjacent to the exit road.  This area 
has adequate capacity for the proposed substation a nd will not have a significant impact 
on the transfer station operations.   
The Hobart II Substation site in Hingham is abutted by the transfer station access road to 
the north, Brewer Reservation municipal conservatio n land to the east, the former 
Hingham landfill to the south, and the Hingham Tran sfer Station to the west.  HMLP’s 
existing Hobart I Substation is located at the nort hwestern corner of the transfer station 
site.  Property uses near the proposed Substation a re generally conservation land and 
transfer station/former landfill.  An aerial view o f the proposed Substation, along with 
environmental resources and land uses within 300 fe et, is provided in Figure 5-9. The 
layout of the proposed Substation is provided as Figure 5-10. 
For either the Preferred or Noticed Alternative Route, the Hobart II Substation will include 
the following activities and addition of equipment: 
• Site clearing and grading within a defined limit of disturbance 
• Construction of a retaining wall 
• Construction of stormwater management system 
• Construction of a gas-insulated switchgear (“GIS”) substation within an 
enclosed structure 
• Installation of fencing 
• Installation of pad-mounted transformers 
• Space for a future transformer and switchgear 
• Space for roll-offs for use by the Town of Hingham Department of Public Works 
(“DPW”) as part of transfer station operations 
 
Circuit breakers and gas-insulated bus work installed at the Hobart II Substation will 
contain SF

5.3.1 Impacts and Mitigation Measures 
Potential Environmental Impacts at Hobart II Substa tion 
Land Use 
The Hobart II Substation site is located at the Hin gham Transfer Station. The transfer 
station site is approximately 9.7 acres and is an active transfer station and capped landfill.  
The existing Hobart Substation is located on a sepa rate parcel at the northwest corner of 
the transfer station.  A portion of land in the nor theast corner of the transfer station site 
has been identified for the proposed Hobart II Subs tation.  This area is a forested 
embankment adjacent to the active transfer station operations that slopes from the 
existing paved area up to the bordering conservatio n area.  The transfer station consists 
of truck loading areas, roll-off for refuse collection, scales, and driveway. 
The Hobart II Substation site in Hingham is abutted  by the transfer station access road 
and Hobart Street to the north, Brewer Reservation municipal conservation land to the 
east, the former Hingham landfill to the south, and  the Hingham transfer station to the 
west.  HMLP’s existing Hobart Substation is located  at the northwestern corner of the 
transfer station site.  Property uses near the proposed Hobart II Substation are generally 
conservation land and transfer station/former landf ill.  The site was chosen after an 
extensive assessment focused on municipal properties in the vicinity of the existing Hobart 
Substation and input from the public.   
The total area of disturbance associated with the substation is approximately 31,000 sf.   
Wetland Resource Areas 
Wetland resource areas in the vicinity of the Hobar t II Substation site were delineated in 
December 15, 2020, and April 1, 2021. Wetland bound aries were established in 
accordance with the provisions of the Massachusetts  Wetlands Protection Act, the 
Hingham Wetlands Regulations, and the United States  Army Corps of Engineers 
methodology based on the plant community, soils, and hydrology.  
The proposed Hobart II Substation is sited outside of the 50-foot buffer zone to a wetland 
resource area located across the transfer station access road.   Approximately 7,100 sf of 
work is proposed between the 50-foot and 100-foot B uffer Zone of delineated BVW 
resource areas.  A small area (approximately 660 sf ) of work (minor grading and 
installation of erosion control measures) is proposed with the 50-foot Buffer Zone to BVW.   
Structural stormwater management BMPs will be imple mented to treat and infiltrate 
stormwater runoff from the new impervious surfaces.   No wetlands will be impacted by 
the Hobart II Substation construction, and no long- term impacts to such resources are 
anticipated associated with construction and operat ion of the substation.  A Notice of 
Intent will be filed with the Hingham Conservation Commission requesting an Order of 
Conditions for this work.

Flood Zones 
Based on the National Flood Insurance Rate Map, Pan el 82, Map Number 25023C0082J, 
revised July 17, 2022, the new substation site is n ot located within a designated Flood 
Zone.  Construction and operation of the Hobart II Substation would not be expected to 
exacerbate local flooding as on-site stormwater man agement systems will be installed to 
control stormwater runoff from new impervious surfaces on-site.   
Stormwater Management 
The proposed stormwater management system will treat both the quality and the quantity 
of stormwater discharge from the site. The system i ncludes BMPs such as deep-sump, 
hooded catch basins, proprietary stormwater treatment units, and a subsurface infiltration 
system.     
A brief description of the proposed BMPs incorporat ed into the stormwater management 
system are as follows: 
• Deep-Sump, Hooded Catch Basins:  Catch basins provi ded throughout the site 
collect stormwater runoff from the proposed parking  areas and are connected to 
the project’s stormwater collection system.  The de ep-sump and hooded outlet 
provide runoff an opportunity to separate from solids and floatable pollutants prior 
to discharge and are used as a pretreatment device throughout the project.    
• Proprietary Treatment Devices: Structural stormwate r treatment devices, 
proposed as Stormceptor 450i, are designed to mecha nically separate pollutants 
from stormwater flows through centrifugal force and  vortex separation.  Units are 
proposed at the ends of both major treatment trains  in the stormwater 
management system, prior to discharging into the su bsurface infiltration system. 
Each unit has been sized in accordance with guidanc e provided by MassDEP to 
insure proper sediment removal efficiencies.  
• Subsurface Infiltration System: The subsurface infi ltration system consists of pre-
fabricated chambers set in a bed of gravel. The system has been sized to infiltrate 
the required recharge volume. Once full, the subsur face infiltration system will 
discharge through an outlet manhole. 
Visual Impacts 
The Hobart II Substation’s location within the Hing ham transfer station property is 
approximately 100 feet from Hobart Street on a forested hillside.  The proposed substation 
will be constructed on approximately ½ acre of land  along the northeastern corner of the 
transfer station site.  The Hobart II Substation includes: 

--- PAGE 126 ---
Section 5 Comparison of Preferred and Noticed Alternative Routes Tighe&Bond 
 
 
Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project  
EFSB Petition 
 5-20 
• New Gas Insulated Substation (enclosed, approximate ly 54 feet x 64 feet 
by 25 feet in height) 
• Circuit breakers 
• Bus work 
• Protection and communications equipment 
• Stormwater management system 
• Retaining wall  
• Space for a future transformer  
• Space for future switchgear 
The substation is screened from Hobart Street by la nd that is part of the Brewer 
Reservation conservation area.  The substation, whi ch at 25 feet is the tallest structure 
within the Hobart II Substation site, will be visib le from within the transfer station and 
from the Brewer Reservation.  The substation will b e enclosed in a steel building similar 
to the transfer station structures. The Substation will be surrounded by an 8-foot-tall chain 
link fence.   
Noise 
Work at the Hobart II Substation site will take pla ce over an approximately 12-18 month 
period. Construction activities will include site p reparation and the installation of a 
retaining wall, stormwater management system, the G IS building, new electrical 
equipment, support structures and foundations.  The  site has been chosen to minimize 
impacts to the nearby residences.  The nearest resi dent is located to the west of the 
transfer station, approximately 400 feet from the p roposed substation site.  During 
construction, nearby residences may be affected by temporarily elevated noise levels 
associated with a typical construction site.  Const ruction will comply with the Town of 
Hingham and MassDEP regulations related to noise.  To further mitigate construction noise 
at nearby residences, HMLP plans to: 
• Require well-maintained equipment with functioning mufflers 
• Require strict compliance with MassDEP’s Anti-Equipment Idling regulations 
• Operate stationary noise generating equipment away from nearby residences 
• Comply with municipal restrictions on construction hours when feasible 
• Work with the Town to schedule construction outside  these hours only where 
necessary. 
HMLP anticipates that these measures will appropria tely minimize construction-related 
noise impacts in the areas near the Hobart II Subst ation and comply with the applicable 
noise ordinances.  No increase in operational noise is anticipated.   
The primary sources of noise in the vicinity of the proposed substation include the existing 
Hobart Substation and the transfer station, which are immediately adjacent to the Hobart 
II Substation area and closer to residences. At thi s time, no transformer is proposed, so 
no new noise emission is anticipated from the site operations. 
Daytime and nighttime noise impacts from the propos ed Project and anticipated 
equipment installations are predicted to fully comply with the applicable Town of Hingham 
Noise Control By-law and MassDEP noise policy.

 5-21 
Traffic 
The proposed Hobart II Substation will be located off public roads, and limited impacts to 
traffic are anticipated for the construction of the substation.  Access to the substation site 
will be through the Hingham Transfer Station access road.  Traffic impacts associated with 
substation construction are expected to be minor an d temporary in nature.  HMLP will 
coordinate construction activities with the DPW so as to minimize impact on the transfer 
station operations.  To the extent practicable, con struction that will require work that 
would disrupt the traffic flow within the transfer station will occur outside of the transfer 
station’s hours of operations, which are currently between the hours of 7:00 AM and 4:00 
PM Thursday through Sunday. At least three weeks pr ior to the start of any work, the 
HMLP will provide a construction schedule and traff ic management plan to the Hingham 
Community Planning Department and Department of Pub lic Works. Said construction 
schedule and traffic management plan will incorpora te assurance that major deliveries 
and site work will minimize disruption to the trans fer station operations.  All construction 
vehicles shall be parked onsite. No construction ve hicles will enter the premises before 7 
AM on any given construction day. 
After construction, the substation will not generat e additional traffic.  HMLP staff will 
access the new Hobart II Substation in a similar ma nner and timing as they currently 
access the existing substation, which is on average  one trip per week unless there are 
outage or operational issues.  The substation will be an unmanned facility.  No additional 
vehicular traffic is anticipated.  
Public Shade Trees 
The proposed construction of the Hobart II Substati on is not anticipated to affect public 
shade trees.  The proposed Hobart II Substation sit e is on a forested hillside that is part 
of the Hingham transfer station.  Approximately 63 trees of 6-inch dbh or greater are 
proposed to be removed prior to site grading.   
Potential to Encounter Subsurface Contamination 
Per MassDEP’s Waste Site & Reportable Releases site  look-up tool, there are no releases 
reported at the proposed substation site.  The prop osed substation is located on a solid 
waste transfer station site and adjacent to a cappe d landfill, the proposed substation site 
is not located in an area that was part of the active landfill.   
Air Quality 
The Hobart II Substation will not adversely affect air quality, either locally or long-range.  
The potential for fugitive dust and for emissions f rom equipment associated with 
construction activities at the Hobart II Substation will be mitigated as described in Section 
5.4.3. 
Electric and Magnetic Fields 
As noted above, the term EMF is used to describe fields created by electric voltage (electric 
fields) and electric current (magnetic fields).  An electric field is present whenever voltage 
exists on an object and is not dependent on current.  Similarly, a magnetic field is present 
whenever current flows in a conductor and is not de pendent on voltage.  When an object 
has voltage and carries current, it produces both an electric and magnetic field. 
HMLP, like all North American electric utilities, s upplies electricity at 60 Hz (60 cycles per 
second).  Therefore, the electric utility system, and the equipment connected to it, produce 
60-Hz (power-frequency) EMF.

 5-22 
Gradient Corporation performed an independent EMF assessment covering all elements of 
the proposed underground 115kV project, including t he proposed Hobart II Substation 
and Weymouth Tap Station.  The proposed Hobart II S ubstation will have GIS, which will 
allow the conductors within the proposed substation to be placed closer together than for 
AIS, enhancing the rapid drop-off of Magnetic Field (“MF”) levels with distance away from 
the equipment.  It is well-established that, for th e types of electrical equipment present 
in the proposed Substation (e.g., aboveground buswork, transformers, switchgear), where 
conductors are arranged in close proximity to each other, that EMF levels decrease rapidly 
to low levels inside the fence line; and the strong est fields near the perimeter fence are 
expected to be associated with the transmission and distribution lines entering/exiting the 
station (IEEE Guide for the Design, Construction, a nd Operation of Electric Power 
Substations for Community Acceptance and Environmen tal Compatibility, published by 
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. [IEEE], 2014).  As a result, it is 
expected that MFs outside the fence lines of the new Substation will be dominated by MFs 
associated with the Project’s underground 115kV transmission line and other transmission 
or distribution lines entering/exiting the stations  rather than equipment within the fence 
lines. 
Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (“ACEC”) or  Outstanding Resource 
Waters  (“ORW”) 
The Weymouth Back River ACEC includes More-Brewer P ark, which is to the north of 
Hobart Street from the transfer station, and Bouve Pond and Cranberry Pond Conservation 
Area, to the west of the transfer station.  The Hob art II Substation will not impact ACEC 
or ORWs.   
Cultural Resources 
Based on review of available records, no inventoried archaeological sites or historic 
properties on the Federal or State Register of Historic Places or the Massachusetts 
Historical Commission’s Inventory of the Historic and Archaeological Assets of the 
Commonwealth are located on, or immediately adjacent to the Project Site.  As there are 
sites in proximity, HMLP is coordinating with the Massachusetts Historical Commission 
(“MHC”) to conduct field investigations on previously undeveloped portions of land near 
the substation site and will continue to coordinate with MHC on the results of this 
investigation.    No impact to any historic or archaeological feature is anticipated in 
association with Project construction or operation.

5.4 General Construction Best Management Practices 
for Preferred and Noticed Alternative Routes 
The Preferred and Noticed Alternative Routes are both fully underground with construction 
in roadways for distances of approximately 3.2 miles and 3.7 miles, respectively. 
This section of the analysis describes the general construction methods and anticipated 
mitigation measures for the underground cable segment of the Project.  The cable will be 
installed using conventional techniques for the con struction of cross-linked polyethylene 
(“XLPE”) underground cables.  Additional information describing the sequence of activities 
and other construction-related topics such as sched ule, underground construction work 
hours and environmental compliance, monitoring and mitigation is provided below. 
5.4.1 General Construction Methods for Underground Cable Installation      
The proposed underground transmission cable will consist of 750 kcmil copper conductor, 
XLPE-insulated cable in a concrete encased manhole and duct bank system.  The typical 
duct bank will consist of three 6-inch-diameter Polyvinyl Chloride (“PVC”) conduits for the 
115kV cables, one 4-inch-diameter PVC conduit for a  protection and communications 
cable, and two 2-inch-diameter PVC conduits one to carry a ground continuity conductor 
and a possible temperature monitoring cable.  The duct bank will be encased in a thermal 
concrete envelope.  
For most duct bank configurations, the top of the d uct bank will be approximately 30 
inches below grade.  The HDD configuration has a mi nimum burial depth of 48 inches 
below grade.  Typical trench excavation for the duc t bank will be up to 4 feet wide and 5 
feet deep or more depending on site conditions.  A typical trench diagram is provided as 
Figure 5-11, Typical Trench Cross Section.  
There are four principal phases of construction for  an underground cable project within 
streets: 
1.  Manhole/splice chamber installation; 
2.  Trenching, duct bank installation, and temporary pavement patching; 
3.  Cable pulling, splicing and testing; and 
4.  Final pavement restoration. 
Installation of the underground transmission line will generally require a linear work zone 
along the construction corridor.  It is anticipated  that areas where typical open trench 
excavation will occur will require a minimum 11-foot-wide work space area and that deep 
excavation at some dense utility intersections (as determined during the detailed design 
phase) may require a minimum of 18-foot-wide work a rea.  Manhole and splice vault 
installations typically require a minimum 20-foot-w ide work area.   HMLP will work with 
local authorities to develop traffic management pla ns to balance construction progress 
and traffic impacts to the community.  These work a reas will include temporary traffic 
control devices necessary to guide motorists safely past the work zone. 
HMLP anticipates that each trench segment will be a pproximately 500 feet in length; 
however, longer or shorter work zones may be used b ased on the specific construction 
activities, soil conditions, traffic, and other site- specific conditions.  It is important to note 
that trench construction is generally a linear progression, with tasks occurring concurrently 
or in progressive sequence.  Approximate durations for activities anticipated to occur 
within each trench segment are summarized in Table 5-1 below.

These durations are approximate and subject to chan ge depending on field conditions, 
depth of the installation, utility congestion and traffic congestion.  Moreover, all phases of 
construction will not necessarily be completed in o ne segment prior to advancing to 
another segment.  There may be cases where work on an unfinished segment may be 
temporarily halted due to unforeseen conditions or to catch up in other areas, and work 
would continue on other segments.  Once the unantic ipated conditions are addressed, 
work would resume on the unfinished segment. 
Each of these four phases is described in more deta il below, followed by a discussion of 
specialized techniques for trenchless road and water crossings, which would be employed 
when warranted -- Pipe Jacking, and Horizontal Directional Drilling. 
Manhole/Splice Chamber Installation 
Manholes will be installed along the underground cable route to facilitate cable installation 
and splicing and to allow access for maintenance re quirements and future repairs.  
Manhole size is determined by the space required to  support pulling, splicing and 
supporting the cable within the manhole.  For the P roject, each manhole will be 
approximately 10 feet wide by 10 feet high and 26 feet long (exterior dimensions). 
Manholes for this Project will typically be spaced approximately 1,500 to 1,800 feet apart. 
Factors contributing to final placement of the manholes include allowable pulling tensions, 
consideration of sidewall pressure on the cables as they are pulled around a bend, and the 
maximum length of a cable that can be transported o n a reel based on the reel’s width, 
height and weight, and accessibility.  For manhole installation, the duration of construction 
typically takes seven to ten construction days per location but may take longer if 
underground utility relocation is necessary.  HMLP will work with the Towns of Hingham 
and Weymouth and utility companies regarding these relocations on a case-by-case basis 
as manhole locations are finalized.  Additional tim e is required for pulling cable 
(approximately four to eight days at each manhole) and splicing cable (approximately five 
days at each manhole), as explained in further detail in this section. 
Following the construction of the new transmission line, manhole inspections will be 
conducted by HMLP personnel on a periodic basis, no rmally every three to five years.  
During these inspections, operators inspect the con dition of cable splices, the cable 
support brackets, the link box connections, and int egrity of concrete walls, as well as the 
junction of conduits as they enter and leave the ma nhole.  The manhole cover is also 
inspected to determine whether it is stable and flush with the road surface.  
Trenching and Duct Bank Installation 
The primary method for underground duct bank construction is open-cut trenching.  Where 
construction takes place within roads, the width of the trench will be marked on the street, 
Dig Safe will be contacted, and the location of the  existing utilities will be marked.  The 
pavement will be saw cut.  Saw cutting provides a clean break in the pavement and defines 
the extents of the trench for the next activity. 
Following saw cutting, the existing pavement will b e removed by pneumatic hammers or 
excavators and loaded into a dump truck with a back hoe/excavator.  Pavement will be 
handled separately from soil, and will be recycled at an asphalt batching plant.  
Subsequently, a backhoe/excavator will excavate the  trench to the required depth.  In 
some areas, excavation may be done by hand or vacuu m excavation methods to avoid 
disturbing existing utility lines and/or service connections.  HMLP will work with utilities to 
maintain agreed-upon separation from other utility lines.

 5-26 
Once excavated, the trench will be sheeted and/or s hored as required by soil conditions, 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) safety rules, and local and state 
regulations. 24   Shoring is designed to permit passage of traffic adjacent to the trench and 
will allow for the trench to be covered with a stee l plate to allow traffic over the trench 
during non-working hours. 
HMLP does not anticipate any planned disruption to utilities along the proposed route.  The 
route is being designed to avoid utility conflicts,  to the extent possible.  During 
construction, unforeseen utility conflicts are alwa ys possible and, if they arise, crews will 
work to address any conflict in the field. For instance, HMLP may slightly shift construction 
locations, if possible.  Small branches or services  to individual buildings may require 
relocation.  HMLP and its contractors would notify and coordinate with the affected resident 
or business in advance should a disruption be required. 
A “clean trench” or “live loading” method will be u sed for removal of excavated soils, 
where soil will be loaded directly into a dump truc k for temporary off-site stockpiling or 
hauling to an off-site facility for recycling, re-use or disposal.  The soil will not be stockpiled 
along the edge of the roadway, thus reducing the si ze of the required work area and 
reducing the potential for sedimentation and nuisan ce dust.  Rock encountered during 
excavation will be removed by mechanical means and brought to an off-site facility for 
recycling, re-use or disposal. 
Intersections tend to have the greatest concentration of underground utilities.  Generally, 
the street intersection is excavated or test pitted  in advance of the other work areas so 
obstructions can be precisely identified and the PV C conduit locations can be determined 
before the main trenching work crew reaches the int ersection.  Within intersections and 
other areas with identified or potentially signific ant subsurface utility congestion, 
temporary or permanent relocation of existing utili ties may be required to install the 
cables. 
Once the open trench is prepared, the conduits will  be assembled and lowered into the 
trench.  The area around the conduits will be fille d with thermal concrete (3,000 pounds 
per square inch).  After the concrete is placed in the trench, it will be back-filled with 
fluidized thermal backfill or native soil, 
25  depending on local requirements, and a 
temporary pavement patch will be installed.   
 
24   The Project will comply with applicable federal, st ate and local safety standards.  
For example, all construction sites will, at a mini mum, adhere to the Federal 
Highway Administration’s Manual to Uniform Traffic Control Devices (“MUTCD”) to 
ensure that both vehicular and pedestrian traffic are safely routed around all street 
and curbside construction activities.  This could i nclude the use of cones, 
barricades, signage, electronic sign boards, or any  combination of the above, as 
required by the MUTCD.  When open trenches are not being actively monitored by 
on-site construction personnel, the trench will be either backfilled or engineered 
road plates will be utilized in order to prevent the public from accidentally accessing 
the trench. 
25   Engineered fluidized thermal backfill has distinc t thermal characteristics, 
specifically with respect to thermal resistivity le vels at low levels of moisture 
content, which native soils in this area may not po ssess.  Limited use of native

Cable Installation and Testing 
Prior to cable installation, each conduit will be tested and cleaned by pulling a mandrel (a 
close-fitting cylinder designed to confirm a condui t’s shape and size) and swab through 
each of the ducts.  When the swab and mandrel have been pulled successfully, the conduit 
is ready for cable installation. 
Three 115kV high voltage cables will be installed b etween two adjacent manholes.  To 
install each cable section, a cable reel or reels w ill be set up at the “pull-in” manhole and 
a cable puller will be set up at the “pull-out” manhole.  Depending on the engineering, the 
pull may include multiple manholes for the pulls. 
Following the initial pulling of the mandrel and pulling line through each duct, a hydraulic 
cable pulling winch and tensioner will be used to individually pull cable from the pull-in to 
the pull-out manhole.  This process will be repeated until all cables have been installed. 
Once adjacent cable sections are installed, they wi ll be spliced together inside the 
manholes.  Splicing high-voltage XLPE transmission cable is a time-consuming, complex 
operation.  It typically requires 40 to 60 hours to complete the splicing of all three cables 
at each manhole.  Each of the three phases will be spliced separately.  The splicing 
activities will take place over four or five extend ed work days at each manhole location.  
Cable splicing is a 12-hour/day activity completed by specialized contractors.  Extended 
work days for cable splicing would entail multiple work shifts that would extend into 
evening hours.  The splicing operation requires a s plicing van and a generator.  The 
splicing van contains all of the equipment and material needed to make a complete splice.  
At times, an air conditioning unit will be used to control the moisture content in the 
manhole.  The portable generator will provide the electrical power for the splicing van and 
air conditioning unit and will be muffled to reduce  noise.  Typically, the splicing van will 
be located over one manhole access.  The air condit ioner will be located near the second 
manhole access and the generator will be located in  a convenient area that does not 
restrict traffic movement around the work zone. 
In addition to the high voltage cable installation and splicing noted above, there are also 
some grounding and auxiliary control cables that wi ll be installed within the duct system.  
There will be a grounding conductor installed withi n the duct system as well as routed 
through the manholes.  This conductor will likely be installed under the same timeline with 
the high voltage cables as outlined above. 
In addition to the high voltage and ground cables, there will be two sets of fiber optic 
cables that will be installed for communication and system protection of the cables.  These 
conductors will likely be installed after the high voltage cable installation is complete.   
Installation of the fiber optic cables is similar to the high voltage cables, though a smaller 
hydraulic cable pulling winch and tensioner may be used to individually pull the fiber optic 
cable from the pull-in to the pull-out manhole.  Th is process will be repeated until all 
cables have been installed. It is typical to be abl e to pull fiber optic cables through more 
pulling manholes, and a greater distance due to the  fact that the fiber reels have longer 
lengths of cable on them and allow for longer pulls . Therefore, the time in a particular 
manhole during the pulling process will take consid erably less time and manhours than 
 
soils may be possible in certain locations around m anholes where exceptional 
thermal performance is not required.

that of the high voltage cable.  HMLP estimates the  time to pull the fiber cables in would 
take approximately 34 days. The splicing activities  for the fiber will take place over two 
work days at each splicing manhole -- for a splicin g timeline of approximately 64 work 
days total.  Similar to High voltage cables, the Fiber Optic Cable splicing is a 12-hour/day 
activity completed by specialized contractors.  Extended work days for cable splicing would 
entail multiple work shifts that would extend into evening hours.  The splicing operation 
requires a splicing van and a generator.  The splic ing van contains all of the equipment 
and material needed to make a complete splice.  At times, an air conditioning unit will be 
used to control the moisture content in the manhole.  The portable generator will provide 
the electrical power for the splicing van and air c onditioning unit and will be muffled to 
reduce noise.  Typically, the splicing van will be located over one manhole access.  The 
air conditioner will be located near the second man hole access and the generator will be 
located in a convenient area that does not restrict traffic movement around the work zone. 
Once the complete cable system is installed, it will be field-tested from the tap station and 
substation.  At the completion of successful testing, the line will be energized.  
Pavement Restoration 
 Upon Project completion, the roads will be restored in accordance with the Department’s 
“Standards to be Employed by Public Utility Operators When Restoring and of the Streets, 
Lanes and Highways in Municipalities” (D.T.E. 98-22 ) (“Repaving Standards”) and 
municipal standards.  
Trenchless Crossing Techniques 
Trenchless installations are used as necessary to minimize impacts to resource areas and 
utilities.  A trenchless installation is proposed t o cross Herring Run Brook and other 
infrastructure, including a flood control conduit, at Jackson Square in Weymouth.  
Trenchless crossing techniques such as pipe jacking  or Horizontal Directional Drilling 
(“HDD”) may be required at crossing locations where  there is some obstruction to open 
trenching such as a railroad, wetlands or high utility congestion.  Section 5.5.4 addresses 
the location of a trenchless crossing that is known  to the Project Team at this time.  
However, during test pitting or during construction , HMLP may encounter existing 
unmapped utilities at depths that require the propo sed transmission line to be placed 
underneath them; in such cases, a trenchless crossing will be considered.  Additionally, if 
HMLP encounters other significant unanticipated uti lity obstructions, and/or unidentified 
culverts, it may consider pursuing a trenchless crossing to avoid such obstructions.  These 
techniques are described in further detail below. 
• Pipe Jacking 
The pipe jacking method is used to install a casing  horizontally under a conflicting 
object where trenching cannot be accommodated or easily accommodated. 
This method is typically used for crossings of less  than 200 feet and is typically 
used for crossings under railroads, ditches, stream s and streets, and for crossing 
under shallower existing underground facilities.  A  pipe jacking installation is 
accomplished by digging a bore pit on one side of t he feature to be crossed and a 
receiving pit on the other side.  The bore pit houses the auger or other equipment 
to remove the spoils from within the pipe, and jack ing equipment, while the 
receiving pit receives the pipe on the other side of the feature being crossed. 

--- PAGE 135 ---

Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project  
EFSB Petition 
 5-29 
The casing is then jacked (pushed) in the bore hole as it is being drilled under the 
feature.  Once in place, the casing is cleaned out, and smaller fiberglass reinforced 
epoxy or PVC pipes are installed inside the casing to contain the cables.  When 
completed, the duct bank will mate up with the casing on each side of the crossing.  
Prior to cable installation, the casing is filled with thermally designed fluidized fill. 
Once the pipe jacking equipment is in place, it mus t remain in place and the drill 
pits must remain open until the operation is completed. 
• Horizontal Directional Drilling  
HDD is typically used for comparatively deeper and longer crossings, such as those 
under interstate highways, major water bodies and r ailroads.  This method 
commonly involves drilling a hole under a conflicti ng object from one side to the 
other, then pulling either a large High Density Pol yethylene (HDPE) casing or 
several smaller HDPE pipes (in a bundle) back through the bore hole.  HDD requires 
boring a hole and circulating a bentonite slurry, w hich helps support the opening 
and remove drill cuttings.   
An HDD installation generally requires a larger tem porary construction footprint 
than pipe jacking because the boring equipment is l arger, and the supporting 
equipment requires more space.   
5.4.2 Construction Schedule and Hours 
As previously noted, assuming receipt of all necessary permits and approvals, construction 
of the Project is anticipated to commence in Spring  2027, continuing over an 18 to 24-
month period, with a target completion by the end of mid-2029. 
Construction hours will be developed in accordance with local noise ordinances, which also 
include regulated construction hours (copies of whi ch are provided in Appendix 5-2) and 
coordination with the Towns of Hingham and Weymouth .  The Town of Hingham limits 
construction hours to 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM, Monday th rough Friday and 8:00 AM to 7:00 
PM on Saturday and Sunday. The Town of Weymouth doe s not have limitations on 
construction hours.  HMLP will coordinate with the Towns of Hingham and Weymouth to 
seek approval when work outside of these hours is n ecessary.  HMLP will also coordinate 
with the Towns to determine areas where construction hours will be limited (e.g., in front 
of schools).  In certain locations, night work may be requested to allow advancement of 
Project construction in areas with traffic congesti on or where other construction projects 
are being advanced simultaneously. 
In areas where manhole installations, cable splicin g, and/or culvert crossings are not 
required, HMLP expects to spend approximately eight to ten days performing construction 
activities in front of any single abutter’s property. 
The duration of time spent in front of a specific abutter’s property for manhole installation, 
cable pulling and high voltage cable splicing will be 16 to 20 days, broken out for each 
task as follows: 
• Approximately 7 to 10 days for manhole installation; 
• Approximately 4 days of pulling activity (two days in each pull direction); and 
• Approximately 5 days for splicing.

Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project  
EFSB Petition 
 5-30 
The actual duration of these activities can vary ba sed on a number of factors, including 
existing utility conditions and below-grade conditions. 
HMLP anticipates that it may not be permitted to wo rk within public roads during the 
winter months due to the winter moratorium for in-s treet construction.  Some activities 
associated with construction, for example, splicing  at manholes, may be allowed under 
the moratorium. 
5.4.3 Construction Mitigation, Compliance, and Monitoring 
Construction mitigation measures will help minimize  the potential for temporary impacts 
to the human and natural environments.  Typical mit igation for stormwater runoff and 
associated erosion and sedimentation, fugitive dust , construction vehicle emissions and 
soils and solid waste management are discussed below for underground line construction.  
Specific discussions of mitigation measures for other environmental impacts are provided 
in subsequent subsections.  At least three weeks prior to the start of any work, HMLP will 
provide a construction schedule and traffic management plan to the Hingham Community 
Planning Department and Hingham and Weymouth Depart ments of Public Works.  Said 
construction schedule and traffic management plan will incorporate assurance that major 
deliveries and site work will minimize disruption to the transfer station operations.  
Stormwater Runoff, Erosion and Sedimentation Control 
HMLP will develop and maintain a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (“SWPPP”) for the 
Project.  The SWPPP will identify controls to manag e construction-related stormwater 
discharges from the Project during construction.  T he SWPPP will include a construction 
personnel contact list, a description of the propos ed work, stormwater controls and spill 
prevention measures, and inspection practices to be  implemented.   The SWPPP will be 
submitted to the Hingham Community Planning Departm ent a minimum of three weeks 
prior to the start of any work. The Hingham Select Board may require, at the applicant’s 
expense, the establishment of a consultant fee acco unt to fund the cost of the SWPPP 
review.  The contractor(s) will be required to adhe re to the SWPPP during all phases of 
Project construction in accordance with the general  conditions prescribed in the USEPA 
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) Construction General Permit. 
HMLP will require that the construction contractor designate a construction supervisor or 
equivalent to be responsible for coordinating with the environmental monitor, to conduct 
regular inspections and to be responsible for compl iance with permit requirements.  This 
person will be responsible for providing appropriat e training and direction to the other 
members of the construction crew regarding any aspe ct of the work as it relates to 
compliance with Project permits and approvals and construction mitigation commitments. 
Additionally, construction personnel will undergo pre-construction training on appropriate 
environmental protection and compliance obligations  prior to the start of construction of 
the Project.  Regular construction progress meeting s will be held to reinforce contractor 
awareness of these mitigation measures. 
Periodically, an environmental monitor working on behalf of HMLP will conduct inspections 
of erosion and sediment controls and ensure complia nce with federal, state and local 
permit requirements and conditions.  Documentation identifying deficiencies of erosion 
control measures and other permit compliance matters will be immediately brought to the 
attention of the contractor for implementation of corrective measures.

A copy of the Final Order issued by the Siting Boar d, and copies of all other permits and 
approvals, will be reviewed by HMLP and provided to  and reviewed by HMLP’s contractor 
prior to construction as part of the contract docum ents.  Contractors will be required to 
understand and comply with Siting Board and/or Depa rtment Orders and conditions and 
requirements for any other applicable Project permits and approvals.  The contractors will 
be required to keep copies of these documents on site and available to all Project personnel 
during construction.  These documents and applicabl e conditions will also be reviewed 
during the construction kick-off meeting in the fie ld between HMLP representatives and 
contractor personnel. 
In roads where work is to be performed adjacent to storm drains and where stormwater 
is directed to a storm drain, HMLP’s contractors wi ll install and maintain filter fabric 
barriers to prevent sediment from entering the storm drain system.  When construction is 
complete at each location, the storm drain barriers will be removed. 
Other measures to mitigate soil erosion will includ e the prompt removal of soils from the 
excavated trench.  Soils will not be stockpiled along the road(s) but instead will be loaded 
directly into trucks to be hauled to an offsite dis posal/re-use area, or to a temporary 
construction laydown area.  This construction method will limit the potential for soils to be 
washed with stormwater into nearby storm drains. 
In addition to the measures discussed above, the ap plicable conditions and provisions of 
the Final Order and other permits and approvals will be reviewed during Project meetings 
and will be discussed as needed during tailboard me etings, where construction personnel 
are briefed by their construction supervisor on the  upcoming day’s work and at that time 
will be reminded by HMLP representatives and the su pervisor of any related specific 
compliance conditions.  
Air Quality 
Dust will be controlled at the construction sites b y use of appropriate methods, including 
the use of dump trucks to move soil out of the cons truction zone, and by covering 
temporary soil stockpiles.  HMLP may also require c ontractors to place water trucks with 
misters in or near the work areas during construction activities. 
Water trucks and street sweeping will be used in co mbination within the roadway 
construction areas.  In addition, HMLP will direct its contractors to retrofit any diesel-
powered non-road construction equipment rated 50 ho rsepower or above to be used for 
30 or more days over the course of the Project with  USEPA-verified (or equivalent) 
emission control devices (e.g., oxidation catalysts  or other comparable technologies).  
HMLP uses ultra-low sulfur diesel (“ULSD”) fuel in its own diesel-powered construction 
equipment.  ULSD has a maximum sulfur content of 15  parts per million as opposed to 
low sulfur diesel fuel, which has a maximum sulfur content of 500 parts per million.  By 
using ULSD fuel, there is a 97 percent reduction in the sulfur content as compared to low 
sulfur diesel fuel.  HMLP will also require contrac tors to use ULSD fuel in their diesel-
powered construction equipment used for this Project. 
HMLP and its contractors will also comply with state law (G.L. c. 90, § 16A) and MassDEP 
regulations (310 CMR 7.11(1)(b)), which limit vehicle idling to no more than five minutes.  
There are exceptions for vehicles being serviced, v ehicles making deliveries that need to 
keep their engines running and vehicles that need t o run their engines to operate 
accessories.  There may be other times when idling is permitted as long as the idling is

 5-32 
absolutely necessary (e.g., as a matter of safety).   Supervisors and foremen at job sites 
are responsible for enforcement of these rules. 
Where work is proposed off-street, there will be in stallation of anti-tracking pads and 
regular sweeping of the pavement of adjacent roadwa y surfaces during the construction 
period to minimize the potential for construction t raffic to kick up dust and particulate 
matter.  
Construction Wastes 
Waste materials generated along the route during in stallation of the transmission duct 
bank and manholes will be promptly removed and re-u sed or properly disposed of at a 
suitable facility.  The largest quantity of constru ction waste will likely be from soils 
excavated for the duct trenches and manholes.  This  material will be removed from the 
trench and hauled to an appropriate off-site dispos al/re-use location or to a temporary 
construction laydown area for on-site re-use.  Conc rete and asphalt will be recycled at a 
local asphalt plant. 
In the event there are contaminated soil or other r egulated materials encountered along 
the route, soils will be managed pursuant to the UR AM provisions of the MCP.  HMLP will 
contract with a licensed site professional (“LSP”) as necessitated by conditions 
encountered along the Project alignment, consistent  with the requirements of the MCP at 
310 CMR 40.0460 et seq.  
Dewatering Protocols 
It is not uncommon to encounter groundwater during construction of underground utility 
facilities.  If feasible based on site-specific con ditions, the least costly method when 
dewatering will typically be to recharge the ground water back into the adjacent 
subsurface.  This can either be done by discharging  back within the open 
excavation/trench associated with the project/pipe installation or discharging to the 
nearby ground surface via a filter bag or dewaterin g corral (if necessary) allowing 
groundwater to infiltrate back into the soil. 
For situations where on-site recharge of groundwate r is not an option and manageable 
(<50,000 gallons) amounts of groundwater are expected to be generated, a vacuum truck 
can be used to pump out and appropriately dispose/r ecycle groundwater encountered.  
Sampling of water will be required to ensure proper disposal/recycling. 
For locations where large amounts (>50,000 gallons) of groundwater are encountered and 
on-site recharge and off-site disposal are not feas ible options, discharging into the 
municipal stormwater and/or sewerage systems may be an option.  However, this activity 
must be coordinated with the municipality and USEPA  beforehand and would not occur 
without written consent from the municipality and the USEPA. 
Coverage under the USEPA NPDES Dewatering and Remed iation General Permit (DRGP) 
would be required for surface water discharges. Per mits would also be required for 
discharges to sanitary sewers such as municipality and/or Massachusetts Water Resources 
Authority (“MWRA”).  As Weymouth is part of the MWR A sewer service area, MWRA 
authorization would be required as well.

5.5 Land Use, Environmental and Cultural Resources 
Impacts Analysis 
As construction will be underground in electric facility Right-of-way and municipal streets, 
there will be no permanent impacts to land use, env ironmental or cultural resources and 
the minor temporary impacts will be largely mitigated.  Nevertheless, HMLP has performed 
a comparative analysis of adjacent land uses and en vironmental and cultural resources 
along the Preferred Route and the Noticed Alternative Route as presented below. 
Categories of potential impacts considered include adjacent land use, traffic and 
transportation, wetlands and water resources, publi c shade trees, subsurface 
contamination, visual, electric and magnetic fields  and noise.  Potential cultural resource 
analysis considered both historic resources (i.e., above-ground buildings, structures, 
districts and objects) and archaeological resources  (i.e., pre-contact and historic 
archaeological sites and areas). 
5.5.1 Environmental Justice Considerations 
As a municipal light plant, HMLP strives to be a th oughtful community partner.  While 
HMLP’s focus is on providing reliable electric services to the Town of Hingham, the Project 
requires infrastructure in both Weymouth and Hingham.  The Project is proposed to cross 
EJ communities within Weymouth, therefore, HMLP con sidered project effects on EJ 
populations and provided meaningful opportunities f or Weymouth residents, including 
members of EJ communities, to participate in the pr oject siting process.  As a project 
partner, Eversource has also focused outreach to pr ovide meaningful opportunities for EJ

5.5.1.1 Background 
In Massachusetts, “An Act Creating a Next Generation Roadmap for Massachusetts Climate 
Police” (c. 8 of the Acts of 2021) (the “Roadmap Act”) brought new focus to environmental 
justice by defining environmental justice populatio ns and environmental burden, and by 
charging agencies of the Commonwealth to meaningful ly involve all people in decisions 
and policies and to consider the equitable distribu tion of environmental benefits and 
burdens.  These EJ principles support protection fr om environmental pollution and the 
ability to live in and enjoy a clean and healthy en vironment, regardless of race, color, 
income, class, handicap, gender identity, sexual or ientation, national origin, ethnicity or 
ancestry, religious belief or English language proficiency.  
The EOEEA Environmental Justice Policy (updated June 24, 2021) charged EOEEA agencies 
to develop strategies for considering environmental justice in decisions and policies.  HMLP 
and Eversource engaged in enhanced public outreach with intent to engage environmental 
justice populations and evaluate environmental burdens.   
Figure 5-12 depicts the Preferred and Noticed Alternative Routes relative to environmental 
justice populations as defined by minority status, income status, English isolation, and/or 
combinations of these attributes, as defined by the Roadmap Act.  
  
 
26   Notably, the Project does not trigger review unde r the Massachusetts 
Environmental Policy Act (“MEPA”).

5.5.1.2 Public Participation 
As discussed in Sections 1.7 and 4.1.5, HMLP held multiple open houses within Weymouth 
to provide opportunities to learn about the Project  and to provide comments on the 
Project.  Two open houses, on August 25, 2022 from 6PM to 8PM and September 13, 2022 
from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, were held at the Tufts Lib rary on Broad Street in Weymouth.  
The library is an accessible public space located in the vicinity of the Project.  The August 
25, 2022 open house was set up with stations where attendees could learn about different 
aspects of the project and talk with subject matter experts.  Based on feedback from this 
session, the September 13, 2022 session included a presentation in addition to the 
information stations.   Each open house was attended by 20 to 30 people.  In addition, an 
open house was held in Hingham on September 28, 202 2 from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM, in 
which people from both Hingham and Weymouth were in  attendance.  A Zoom meeting 
was also held on October 13, 2022 at 7:00 PM to rea ch people in both Towns who were 
unable to attend in person.  
In addition, Eversource hosted meetings in Weymouth  at Union Towers I on January 25, 
2024 from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM and at Union Towers II on January 26, 2024 from 10:00 
AM to 11:00 AM.  These meetings were targeted to th e Union Towers population.  Union 
Towers was chosen as it provides affordable housing  for the elderly and disabled.  
Approximately 25 people attended this event.  Revie w of the Massachusetts EJ mapper – 
languages spoken map – indicates that there are no census tracts within one mile of the 
project where at least 5% of the population are spe akers who report they do not speak 
English "very well".  Eversource researched languag es spoken within the Union Towers 
population, and provided a Cantonese interpreter on  site that was utilized by seven 
residents. Materials were distributed in English an d Traditional Chinese and were also 
made available in Spanish.  The focus of these meetings was on the Tap Station, and HMLP 
representatives were in attendance to address quest ions and comments on the 
transmission line.  
Eversource hosted an additional meeting on March 19 , 2024 from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM at 
the Crossroads Worship Center, which is located across Broad Street from the Tap Station 
site.  Although Spanish and Portuguese interpreters  were present, there were no 
interpretation needs identified in advance, and mat erials were available in English, 
Portuguese, Traditional Chinese and Spanish. The fo cus of this Open House was on the 
Tap Station, and HMLP representatives were in atten dance to address questions and 
comments on the transmission line.   
HMLP also contacted the EOEEA Office of Environmental Justice & Equity for a list of CBOs 
in the project area.  A letter informing the CBOs o f the project and offering to meet with 
representatives of the CBOs was mailed to each CBO in March 2023.  No response was 
received. 
Information on the project is also available on the  HEIRP website (www.HEIRP.com).  
Project updates are posted on this site, and there is link on the website that people can 
use to provide feedback to HMLP.  HMLP will continu e to communicate status updates on 
the project, offering opportunities for public inpu t throughout the siting, permitting and 
construction phases.

5.5.1.3 Assessment of Potential Impacts on Environm ental Justice 
Communities 
The proposed project involves the construction of a  new tap station in Weymouth, a new 
substation in Hingham, and a 115kV transmission line linking the two stations.  The Project 
does not generate energy, nor does it result in any industrial discharges.  Again, it should 
be noted that the Project does not trigger review u nder MEPA.  HMLP looked at several 
alternatives to the Project, as summarized in Secti on 3, and as there are no existing 
transmission lines for HMLP to tap into within Hing ham, impacts to the neighboring Town 
of Weymouth are unavoidable.  HMLP analyzed several  sites for both the Weymouth Tap 
Station and Hobart II Substation, and chose locatio ns that were adjacent to existing 
infrastructure and away from residences to minimize  the environmental burden.  The 
Weymouth Tap Station site is located in an area mapped as Environmental Justice for the 
income criteria.  As noted previously, the site is adjacent to existing electrical transmission 
infrastructure and the Tap Station has been sited away from residences.  
The new transmission line will be underground, and the primary impact of the project will 
be related to construction, similar to other underg round infrastructure projects (e.g., 
water, sewer, stormwater).  Underground infrastruct ure is prevalent throughout 
Massachusetts and within the project area.  The pur pose of the proposed project is to 
provide a reliable energy source to HMLP’s customer s.  Due to the limitations of the 
existing electric grid locations, the transmission portion of the Project needs to cross 
Weymouth to reach Hingham.  The Preferred and Noticed Alternative Routes both traverse 
areas mapped as Environmental Justice for minority populations in Weymouth.  HMLP will 
minimize impacts and incorporate mitigation measure s as noted above in Section 5.4 to 
address construction period impacts, including nois e, air emissions, and traffic 
management.   
In summary, the Project will not result in disparat e impact to EJ populations.  Potential 
impacts associated with the project are primarily related to temporary impacts associated 
with construction of the transmission line.  These impacts will be the same for both EJ and 
non-EJ populations.  HMLP has identified minimization and mitigation measures to address 
the anticipated unavoidable construction-phase impa cts of the project.  The Project will 
not have a disproportionately adverse human health or environmental impact to EJ 
populations in the Project Area. 
5.5.2 Adjacent Land Use 
Land use along the Preferred Route and Noticed Alte rnative Route was assessed using 
MassGIS 2016 Land Use data as well as MassGIS parcel data.  Land use was tabulated in 
acres within approximately 100 feet of the edge of the existing roadway edge along each 
segment.  Results are listed in Table 5-2 (Land Use  within 100 feet Preferred Route and 
Noticed Alternative Route).  MassGIS land-use data are also shown on Figures 5-3 and 5-
6 for the Preferred Route and Noticed Alternative Route, respectively.

Preferred Route 
The dominant land use proximate to the Preferred Ro ute is residential along the local 
streets, with approximately 35.75 acres of resident ial use within 100 feet of the route.  
There are approximately 604 residential units adjac ent to the Preferred Route. The 
Preferred Route has approximately 63 adjacent comme rcial and/or industrial land uses.  
Additional land uses along Broad Street include forests and open land. The routing analysis 
in Section 4 considered proximity to sensitive rece ptors, defined as hospitals, police/fire 
stations, elder care facilities/nursing homes, schools, daycare facilities, places of worship, 
parkland, protected open space and funeral homes.  There are 18 sensitive receptors 
located along the Preferred Route: 
• Crossroads Worship Center 
• Crossroads Enrichment Center 
• Connel Rink and Pool 
• Academy Avenue School Playground 
• Clapp Memorial Park 
• Weymouth Afterschool Stars 
• Currie Daycare

Noticed Alternative Route 
The dominant land use proximate to the Noticed Alte rnative Route is residential, with 
approximately 44.24 acres residential use within 10 0 feet of the route.  There are 
approximately 878 residential units adjacent to the  Noticed Alternative Route and 813 
adjacent to the Noticed Alternative Route Variation. Additional land uses along Lake Street 
include forests and open land and commercial. The N oticed Alternative Route has 
approximately 22 adjacent commercial and/or industrial land uses. The Noticed Alternative 
Route Variation has approximately 38 adjacent commercial and/or industrial land uses. 
There are ten sensitive receptors located along the Noticed Alternative Route: 
• Crossroads Worship Center 
• Crossroads Enrichment Center 
• Humphrey Field 
• Town of Weymouth Recreation 
• Weymouth Youth and Family Services 
• Herring Run Park 
• Herring Run Pool Park  
• More-Brewer Park 
• Zsigalov Daycare

• Weymouth Preschool Stars 
• Humphrey Field 
• East Weymouth Congregational Church/ South Shore Stars Weymouth Preschool 
• More-Brewer Park 
• Herring Run Park

• Zsigalov Daycare 
• Brewer Reservation 
 
Comparison 
The Preferred Route is shorter and is adjacent to m ore commercial and industrial uses 
than the Noticed Alternative Route.  The Noticed Al ternative Route (and variation) is 
adjacent to more residential uses, including afford able housing developments.  The 
Preferred Route has fewer residences and, as the route length is shorter, the duration and 
extent of transmission line construction near sensi tive receptors and residences will be 
less, the Preferred Route is superior to the Noticed Alternative for this criterion. 
Impact Mitigation 
The potential for the Preferred Route or Notice Alt ernative Route (and variation) to affect 
adjacent land use is limited.  There are no permanent changes to land use associated with 
construction of the transmission line along either route.  Temporary impacts to residences, 
businesses and sensitive receptors may include traf fic disruption, including roadway lane 
closures and construction noise and air quality impacts.  Construction hours will be limited

in the vicinity of schools and proper construction best management practices (“BMPs”) will 
be in place to reduce traffic, noise and air quality impacts. 
5.5.3 Traffic and Transportation Impacts 
This section evaluates the potential for impacts to traffic, parking and public transportation 
along the Preferred Route and Noticed Alternative Route.  Traffic impacts associated with 
the underground work in public roads will be tempor ary in nature and confined to the 
period necessary to construct the Project.  A varie ty of mitigation measures will be used 
to minimize traffic disruption during construction.   Implementation of a well-designed 
Traffic Management Plan (“TMP”) will reduce the potential for inconvenience to drivers and 
those using public transportation, as well as any p otential secondary effects on local 
businesses.  Access to local businesses and residen ces will be maintained throughout 
Project construction. 
To compare potential traffic impacts of the Preferred Route and Noticed Alternative Route, 
HMLP reviewed existing traffic and parking conditio ns, roadway widths, travel lanes, and 
the presence of public bus service along each route , as well as the options for traffic 
mitigation along each route. 
Preferred Route 
The total length of the Preferred Route is approxim ately 3.2 miles, the majority of which 
is located within public roads.  The majority of th e roads comprising the Preferred Route 
can generally be described as medium volume roads with a mix of functional classifications 
of minor arterials and major collectors and are all  classified as two-way vehicular flow.  
The roads are all two-way roads and would require a  combination of lane shifts and road 
closures/detours.  High Street and Broad Street are functionally classified as Minor Arterial 
Roads, and French Street and Hobart Street are func tionally classified as Major Collector 
Roads.  
MBTA Bus Route 222 (East Weymouth – Quincy Center S tation) coincides with the 
Preferred Route along Broad Street and High Street;  there are eighteen bus stops along 
the Preferred Route portion of Broad Street. 
Work within areas of traffic congestion or near certain sensitive receptors will be managed 
to minimize construction related impacts.  A TMP wi ll be prepared and will include active 
and passive traffic management measures, including the use of police details.  Night work 
typically is implemented in areas that have the following characteristics: (1) the segment 
experiences high traffic volumes and congestion dur ing the day; (2) the adjacent land 
uses are primarily commercial and/or industrial; and/or (3) the municipality has required 
HMLP to construct at night.  The primary advantage of night work is that it can minimize 
traffic congestion by avoiding hours of peak traffi c volumes and avoiding potential 
business interruptions.  The Towns may request nigh t work to alleviate traffic impacts.  
Any such work outside of typical construction hours  will be closely coordinated with local 
officials and any necessary local authorizations will be sought by HMLP.

Noticed Alternative Route 
The total length of the Noticed Alternative Route i s 3.7 miles, all of which is located in 
public roads.  The majority of the roads comprising  the Noticed Alternative Route can 
generally be described as low to medium volume local roads.  As with the Preferred Route, 
the roads are all two-way roads and would require a  combination of lane shifts and road 
closures/detours.  Essex Street, French Street, Hob art Street and Spring Street are 
functionally classified as Major Collector Roads, B road Street and High Street are 
functionally classified as Minor Arterial Roads and  Lake Street and Shawmut Street are 
functionally classified as Local Roads. MBTA Bus Ro ute 222 (East Weymouth – Quincy 
Center Station) includes eleven stops along the Noticed Alternative Route. 
Work within areas of traffic congestion or near cer tain sensitive receptors would be 
managed to minimize impacts to traffic and disturbances affecting nearby residences and 
businesses.  A TMP would be prepared and would incl ude active and passive traffic 
management measures, including the use of police details.

Comparison 
In order to compare traffic impacts along the Prefe rred Route and Noticed Alternative 
Route, HMLP assessed a number of indicators of pote ntial traffic congestion as described 
above. Based on the route evaluation and scoring an alysis provided in Section 4 of the 
Analysis (see Table 4-5), the Noticed Alternative R oute scored more favorably for 
transportation impacts than the Preferred Route, pr imarily due to the higher volume of 
traffic on Broad Street and the number of bus stops on Broad Street. 
Each route would require implementation of TMPs and  close coordination with the Towns 
of Hingham and Weymouth to ensure that traffic dela ys are minimized.  Traffic 
management measures, including use of police details and implementation of detours and 
lane closures, would be required regardless of the route selected.  While the Noticed 
Alternative Route scored more favorably in the tran sportation impact criteria than the 
Preferred Route for the routing analysis, the Broad  Street route would provide greater 
flexibility for transportation management options t han the Lake Street route due to the 
greater width of Broad Street.

HMLP is committed to mitigating traffic impacts to the fullest extent possible along either 
route.   
Impact Mitigation 
Upon completion of the detailed design work and pri or to the start of construction, HMLP 
will work closely with the Towns of Weymouth and Hi ngham to develop a TMP.  Topics to 
be addressed in the TMP will include: 
• Width and lane location of the work zone to minimize impacts to vehicular traffic; 
• Work schedule and duration of lane closures, road c losures, or detours (where 
applicable); 
• The use of traffic-control devices such as barricad es, reflective barriers, advance 
warning signs, traffic regulation signs, traffic-control drums, flashers, detour signs, 
and other protective devices to be placed as shown on plans and as approved by 
the Towns of Hingham and Weymouth; 
• Locations where temporary provisions may be made to  maintain access to homes 
and businesses; 
• Routing and protection of pedestrian and bicycle traffic; 
• Maintenance of MBTA service and school bus service; 
• Communication with adjacent businesses, so critical  product deliveries are not 
interrupted by construction; 
• Notification to municipal officials, local businesses, and the public of the timing and 
duration of closed curbside parking spaces and travel way restrictions; and 
• Coordination between HMLP and police and fire depar tments to ensure that 
emergency access through the route be provided at all times.  In most cases, travel 
past the work zone will be open to one-way alternating travel under police control.  
In this circumstance, the police officer(s) will st op all traffic, thereby providing 
passage of the emergency vehicle.  In the rare inst ance that a roadway is closed 
temporarily to traffic, emergency vehicles would still be permitted to pass through 
the work zone as all construction activity would cease temporarily and a section of 
roadway would be cleared of all contractor vehicles and equipment. 
The scope of the TMP will include analysis of the r oads affected by the transmission line 
construction.  The TMP will be submitted for review and approval by appropriate municipal 
authorities prior to construction.  Traffic-control  plans will be developed consistent with 
the FHWA Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways and the 
MassDOT publication, “Work Zone Safety”.  HMLP will  also closely coordinate with local 
officials and abutting property owners. 
5.5.4 Wetlands and Water Resources 
Wetland and water resources include river crossings , wetland crossings, riverfront area 
and Chapter 91 jurisdiction limits.  As described in Section 4 of the Analysis, the evaluation 
of the wetland resource areas criterion involved re viewing MassGIS databases and 
conducting field reconnaissance to determine the nu mber of resource areas the routes 
would cross. The evaluation of wetland crossings in volved reviewing MassGIS data and 
conducting field reconnaissance to determine the nu mber of local- and state-regulated 
resource areas, as defined in the Massachusetts Wet lands Protection Act (MWPA)

Anticipated wetlands-related permitting includes an Order of Conditions from the Hingham 
and Weymouth Conservation Commission.  As noted abo ve, HMLP is proposing to cross 
the Herring Run Brook through HDD technology to minimize impacts to this resource. 
Given that the underground cable construction assoc iated with the Noticed Alternative 
Route is anticipated to occur within existing paved roadways and disturbed rights of way, 
no permanent impacts to wetlands or streams are anticipated.   
Comparison 
Both the Preferred Route and Noticed Alternative Ro ute will include crossings of work 
within jurisdictional wetland and water resources, the temporary impacts are minor and 
there will be no permanent impacts.  The Noticed Al ternative Route is within the vicinity 
of Whitman Pond, which is an Emergency Surface Wate r Supply for the Town of 
Weymouth.  The wetland resource areas along the Preferred Route and Noticed Alternative 
Route consist of roadway rights-of-way and existing culverts, and therefore, the Preferred 
Route and Noticed Alternative Route will not alter the values of the resource areas.  
Moreover, all of the activities proposed in wetland  and water resource areas and buffer 
zones can be designed to conform to applicable loca l, state and Federal wetlands 
regulatory programs. The Preferred Route is superior to the Noticed Alternative Route for 
this criterion due to less impacts within Riverfront Area. 
Impact Mitigation 
The potential impacts are limited, as noted above, and are within the footprint of 
previously disturbed areas.  Neither underground route in public roads requires any filling 
or clearing within wetlands.  The project proposes to avoid and minimize impacts to the 
Herring Run Brook and its associated 100-foot flood plain (BLSF) by using HDD 
construction to install the new transmission line b eneath the Herring Run Brook.  Given 
that the vast majority of underground cable constru ction is anticipated to occur within 
existing paved roadways, no permanent impacts to we tlands or streams are anticipated.  
To address the potential for erosion and sedimentat ion within wetland resource areas, a

SWPPP will be prepared for the Project that will sp ecify erosion control measures to be 
implemented.  
5.5.5 Public Shade Trees 
M.G.L. Chapter 87 defines public shade trees as all trees within a public way or within the 
boundaries thereof.  A field reconnaissance was con ducted to count all trees within the 
public way along the route regardless of diameter a t breast height or distance from the 
proposed cable trench, as described in Section 4 of  the Analysis.  As is typical for this 
mostly residential environment, the canopies of cer tain trees on the Preferred Route and 
the Noticed Alternative Route extend out over the r oad.  Construction proposed in paved 
roadways is not anticipated to require the removal of any trees along either the Preferred 
Route or the Noticed Alternative Route.  No permane nt impacts to public shade trees are 
proposed, however potential temporary impacts inclu de trimming of branches and 
exposure or cutting of roots. 
Preferred Route 
There are 27 public shade trees within the public way associated with the Preferred Route.  
No permanent impacts to public shade trees are anti cipated to be required as part of the 
installation of the underground transmission line within the Preferred Route. 
Noticed Alternative Route 
There are 33 public shade trees within the public w ay associated with the Noticed 
Alternative Route and 34 public shade trees associated with the variation.  No permanent 
impacts to public shade trees are anticipated to be  required as part of the installation of 
the underground transmission line within the Noticed Alternative Route. 
Comparison 
As noted below, HMLP anticipates coordination with Weymouth and Hingham Tree 
Wardens regarding public shade tree protection and replacement where required.  Due to 
both the Preferred Route and the Noticed Alternative Route and variation having a similar 
number of public shade trees, HMLP determined the r outes were comparable for this 
criterion. 
Impact Mitigation 
Typical mitigation measures to protect public shade  trees along the underground route 
segments include: 
• Prior to construction, HMLP will meet with the loca l Tree Wardens to confirm the 
location and condition of public shade trees and other trees along the route relative 
to construction work areas.  HMLP will review BMPs and finalize a monitoring and 
mitigation plan for the protection of public shade trees and applicable regulated 
trees during construction.

• Where trees are encountered within 15 feet of trench edges, they will be protected 
from bark and limb damage by surrounding them with wire-bound 2x4 lumber to 
an appropriate height depending on the particular tree.  Alternative tree protection 
may be used if accepted in advance by the property owner(s).  Where tree roots 
are encountered during excavation, mechanical excavation will cease, roots will be 
exposed by hand (to the least extent possible, see discussion below), and will be 
kept moist and covered with wet burlap or plastic throughout the exposure period.  
Thermal backfill will be placed in the trench in a manner to avoid impacting tree 
roots. 
 
• Erect and maintain a temporary fence around the per imeter of individual tree pits 
(typically the area between the curb and sidewalk w here the tree resides).  The 
temporary fence will remain in place for the duration of construction and will serve 
to: prohibit the storage of construction materials,  debris, or excavated material 
within tree pit area or on any sidewalks; and prohi bit vehicles, equipment or foot 
traffic within tree pit area.  Although unlikely, i f excavation is required within the 
tree pit area and/or sidewalk, the Tree Wardens will be contacted before any work 
begins.  The Tree Wardens will determine whether th e contractor on site may 
commence with the work, or if a qualified arborist must be hired to conduct root 
pruning.  If permission is granted to the contractor to commence with root pruning, 
the following practices will be implemented: (1) na rrow-tine spading forks or 
compressed air will be used to comb soil to expose roots; (2) roots will be cut 
cleanly after excavation with clean, sharp tools, t o promote callus formation and 
wound closure; (3) tree rooting will be dressed wit h a hormone compound; and 
(4) the excavation will be backfilled as soon as po ssible and the soil around the 
roots will be watered to avoid leaving air pockets.  If backfilling immediately is not 
possible, the exposed roots will be covered with we t burlap and watered regularly 
to prevent roots from drying out, and backfilling w ith soil will occur as soon as 
possible. 
 
• Trees and vegetation will be replaced in a manner approved by the Tree Wardens. 
5.5.6 Subsurface Contamination 
Subsurface excavation associated with the Project h as the potential to encounter 
contaminated soils from historical releases and/or urban fill in the vicinity of both the 
Preferred Route and Noticed Alternative Route.  A r eview of the MassDEP waste site list 
on-line database was performed to determine the pot ential to encounter subsurface 
contamination along each route at listed sites.  Th e online database was used to collect 
and review information on MassDEP-listed sites (sites issued an RTN) directly abutting the 
routes.

Impact Mitigation 
If contaminated soils are encountered, they will be managed pursuant to URAM provisions 
of the MCP. HMLP will prepare a soil and groundwater management plan, and will contract 
with an LSP as necessitated by conditions encounter ed along the Project alignment, 
consistent with the requirements of the MCP at 310 CMR 40.0460 et seq.  All excess soil 
will be managed in accordance with local, State and Federal regulations. 
5.5.7 Visual Assessment 
Because the transmission line portion of the Projec t is underground, the only potential 
permanent visual impacts associated with the transmission line are those associated with 
vegetation clearing.  As noted below, minimal impact to vegetation is proposed. 
Preferred Route 
Visual impacts associated with the Preferred Route are anticipated to be minimal, as no 
public shade trees are anticipated to be directly i mpacted by the installation of the 
underground transmission line within the existing paved roadways of the Preferred Route. 
Noticed Alternative Route 
Visual impacts associated with the Noticed Alternative Route are anticipated to be minimal, 
as no public shade trees are anticipated to be dire ctly impacted by the installation of the 
underground transmission line within the existing p aved roadways of the Noticed 
Alternative Route. 
Comparison 
Because the potential for visual impact on both rou tes relative to underground line 
construction is similar, HMLP determined the routes were comparable for this criterion. 
Impact Mitigation 
As described in Section 5.4.4, HMLP anticipates coo rdination with the local Tree Wardens 
regarding public shade tree protection and replacement where required. 
5.5.8 Electric and Magnetic Fields 
As noted above, the term EMF is used to describe fields created by electric voltage (electric 
fields) and electric current (magnetic fields).  An electric field is present whenever voltage 
exists on an object and is not dependent on current.  Similarly, a magnetic field is present 
whenever current flows in a conductor and is not de pendent on voltage.  When an object 
has voltage and carries current, it produces both an electric and magnetic field. 
HMLP, like all North American electric utilities, s upplies electricity at 60 Hz (60 cycles per 
second).  Therefore, the electric utility system, and the equipment connected to it, produce 
60-Hz (power-frequency) EMF.

Preferred Route 
HMLP modeled EMF levels associated with the proposed transmission facilities at sections 
representative of the post-Project circuit configur ations under average annual loading 
conditions and anticipated system peak loading cond itions.  The FIELDS computer 
program, designed by Southern California Edison, wa s utilized to calculate MF strengths 
from the Project’s underground 115kV transmission l ine.  This program operates using 
Maxwell's equations, which accurately apply the law s of physics as related to electricity 
and magnetism (EPRI, 1982, 1993).  Modeled fields u sing this program are both precise 
and accurate for the input data utilized.  Results of the model have been checked 
extensively against each other and against other so ftware (e.g., CORONA, from the 
Bonneville Power Administration, US Department of E nergy) to ensure that the 
implementation of the laws of physics are consisten t.  In these validation tests, program 
results for MF levels were found to be in very good agreement with each other (Mamishev 
and Russell, 1995).  These methods have been shown to accurately predict EMF levels 
measured near transmission lines.  The EMF levels w ere calculated at one meter (3.28 
feet) above ground, in accordance with standard pro tocol. The EMF Report is included as 
Appendix 5-3.   
MF modeling was performed by Gradient for four representative Project underground line 
cross sections.   
The HDD bore installation case is to be used for in stalling the Project cables beneath 
Herring Run Brook in Weymouth.  This installation case was found to have the lowest peak 
aboveground MF levels directly above the circuit centerline due to the greater burial depth 
(minimum of four feet beneath the ground surface).  Some concerns have been raised 
regarding potential impacts of magnetic fields from  the Project underground cables on 
river herring (alewife and blueback herring) during  their annual migration to upstream 
spawning grounds via Herring Run Brook.  However, it is not established that river herring 
are either magnetosensitve or rely at all on the ea rth's geomagnetic field to navigate to 
their spawning grounds.  For example, the Naisbett- Jones and Lohmann (2022) review 
paper on magnetoreception and magnetic navigation in fish included no references to river 
herring as being among the fish species for which there is evidence of magnetoreception.   
For example, peer-reviewed journal articles and gov ernmental reports focused on river 
herring and their migration ( e.g ., Yako et al ., 2002; Greene et al ., 2009; Legett et al ., 
2021) make no reference to magnetic fields, such as  the earth's geomagnetic field, as 
being among the potential environmental cues involv ed in the mechanism of migration.  
Greene et al . (2009) specifically pointed to olfaction as the " primary means for homing 
behavior" for the alewife herring species.  NOAA (2 007) referred to changing water 
temperatures as an initiator of seasonal migrations for alewife herring.   
Regardless, even if river herring are in fact magne tosensitive and use the earth's 
geomagnetic field for navigation/migration purposes , the Project 60-Hz AC cables will 
generate time-varying AC magnetic fields that diffe r from the earth's static ( i.e ., steady, 
0 Hz) geomagnetic field.  It is not established that magnetosensitive marine species, such 
as salmon, eels, and sharks, which are believed to utilize the earth's steady geomagnetic 
field for navigation and orientation purposes, can detect and respond to 60-Hz AC 
magnetic fields (CSA Ocean Sciences Inc. and Expone nt, 2019).  Notwithstanding the 
difference between 60-Hz AC magnetic fields and ste ady (0 Hz) magnetic fields, there is 
also an absence of scientific evidence that magnetic field fluctuations could serve as major 
barriers to migration.  For example, for Chinook sa lmon smolts and adult green sturgeon 
that have been reported to orient to magnetic field s and that thus may use them as a 
guide for migration, Klimley et al . (2017) reported that the large anomalies in stead y

magnetic fields produced by bridges were not found to present major barriers to the 
migration of these fish species in the San Francisco Estuary.  
The calculated magnetic fields are found in Tables 5-9 and 5-10.

The MF modeling analysis showed that all modeled po st-Project MF values for each 
representative cross section at both annual average and system peak load levels, including 
directly above the circuit centerlines, are well below the ICNIRP health-based guideline of 
2,000 mG for allowable public exposure to 60-Hz AC magnetic fields (ICNIRP, 2010).  This 
is the case despite a conservative modeling approac h that did not consider the small 
reductions in magnetic fields from the induced GCC currents.  In all cases, aboveground 
MF values dropped off rapidly with increasing later al distance from the circuit centerlines 
(e.g ., 88-93% reductions at lateral distances of ±25 ft from circuit centerlines), such that 
aboveground MF levels decreased to negligible level s at short distances beyond the 
trenches.   
In addition, MFs for the HDD bore installation case where the Project 115kV underground 
circuit will cross beneath Herring Run Brook in Weymouth are not expected to impact the 
annual migration of river herring to their upstream spawning grounds.  
 
Noticed Alternative Route and Variation 
The EMF levels for the Noticed Alternative and Vari ation would be the same as the 
Preferred Route.  
Comparison 
The anticipated EMF levels for both routes are equivalent.

5.5.9 Noise Impacts 
Noise impacts associated with the proposed transmis sion line are limited to temporary 
construction noise.  As discussed in Section 5.3.1,  there are four principal phases of 
construction for underground cable projects within the streets conducted in sequence at 
each location. Work for the transmission line will take place over an approximately 
24-month period. 
Several phases of construction will likely be ongoing simultaneously along various sections 
of the route, such as: manhole placement, roadway c utting, excavation of fill, conduit 
placement, and backfilling and temporary paving.  D uring later portions of the Project, 
cable pulling and splicing (electrical) phases may overlap with ongoing civil construction 
activities. 
The potential for noise impacts from Project constr uction is a function of the specific 
receptors along the route as well as the equipment used and proposed hours of operation.  
Construction is anticipated to occur during typical work hours, though in specific instances, 
at some locations, or at the request of the Towns, HMLP may seek municipal approval to 
work at night. 
Transmission line construction will generate noise levels that are periodically audible along 
the Project route, at conductor pulling sites, and at staging areas.  The construction 
equipment to be used will be similar to that used during typical public works projects (e.g., 
road resurfacing, storm sewer installation, water l ine installation).  In general, the sound 
levels from construction activity will be dominated  by the loudest piece of equipment 
operating at the time.  Therefore, at any given Pro ject location, the loudest piece of 
equipment will be the most representative of the expected sound levels in the area.   
Maximum sound levels from typical equipment that will be used during construction of the 
underground cable are listed in Table 5-12 at a reference distance of 50 feet. 27   The sound 
levels provided are the calculated contribution from the construction equipment/activities 
based on approximations of sound propagation. 
Construction equipment proximity to noise-sensitive  land uses will vary along the 
transmission line routes.  Because sound levels fro m a point source drop off due to 
geometric divergence (hemispherical spreading) at a rate of 6 dB per doubling of distance, 
the reference sound levels at 50 feet will decrease by 6 decibels (“dBA”) for locations 100 
feet back from the edge of construction.  For examp le, maximum excavator sound levels 
at 100 feet would be expected to be approximately 7 5 dBA.  In a more urbanized area, 
setbacks may be only 25 feet from construction acti vity, thus increasing the sound levels 
from each piece of equipment by 6 dBA.  For example , an excavator at 25 feet would be 
expected to produce a maximum sound level of 87 dBA.   
 
27   A typical sound level distance of 50-feet from re sidences, businesses and sensitive 
receptors is provided herein for discussion purposes as HMLP has not yet identified 
the locations of the proposed duct bank, manholes and splicing locations within the 
public road alignments.  The locations of these activities and structures relative to 
residences and sensitive receptors will be determin ed during the detailed design 
process.

Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project  
EFSB Petition 
 5-53 
 
Construction equipment is generally not operated co ntinuously, with significant variation 
in power and usage.  Sound levels would fluctuate, depending on the construction activity, 
equipment type and separation distances between sou rce and receiver.  Other factors, 
such as vegetation, terrain and noise attenuating f eatures, such as buildings, will act to 
further reduce construction noise levels.  Construc tion activities, including cable 
installation and testing, are described in detail in Section 5.3. 
Noise impacts are regulated by the Town of Hingham Noise Control By-law as well as by 
MassDEP.  Under the local regulations, construction  is limited to the hours 7:00 AM to 
7:00 PM, Monday through Friday and 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM on Saturday and Sunday, unless 
a permit is obtained from the Enforcement Official,  which includes the Chief of Police or 
any Town board, department, or official having regu latory authority over Construction 
activity.  Should off-hours construction be require d, HMLP will seek a permit.  Daytime 
and nighttime noise impacts from the proposed Proje ct and anticipated equipment 
installations are predicted to fully comply with th e applicable Town of Hingham Noise 
Control By-law and MassDEP Air Pollution Control (3 10 CMR 7.00) and noise policy when 
compared to measured background sound levels at the  closest sensitive receptor 
locations.

Preferred Route 
Sensitive receptors along the Preferred Route inclu de park/recreation facilities, medical 
facilities, a school, and places of worship.  In general, the area along the Preferred Route 
has a greater number of sensitive receptors, but a lower density of residences than the 
Noticed Alternative Route.  Daytime and nighttime n oise impacts from the proposed 
Project and anticipated equipment installations are predicted to comply with the applicable 
Town of Hingham Noise Control By-law, MassDEP Air P ollution Control (310 CMR 7.00) 
and MassDEP noise policy when compared to measured background sound levels at the 
closest sensitive receptor locations.  Should off-hours construction be required, HMLP will 
seek required permits.  Town of Weymouth officials will also be consulted about 
construction practices and noise reduction strategies. 
Noticed Alternative Route 
The Noticed Alternative Route generally has a highe r density of residential uses than the 
Preferred Route, however the Noticed Alternative Route does have slightly fewer sensitive 
receptors than the Preferred Route.  As with the Pr eferred Route, noise impacts are 
predicted to comply with the applicable Town of Hingham Noise Control By-law, MassDEP 
Air Pollution Control (310 CMR 7.00) and MassDEP no ise policy when compared to 
measured background sound levels at the closest sensitive receptor locations.  Should off-
hours construction be required, HMLP will seek requ ired permits.  Town of Weymouth 
officials will also be consulted about construction practices and noise reduction strategies.  
However, the degree of construction-related noise generated by the Project is anticipated 
to be similar for both the Noticed Alternative Route and the Preferred Route, and potential 
impacts from noise are anticipated to be temporary in nature.   
Comparison 
The level of construction-related noise associated with underground line construction 
would be similar along most of the Preferred Route and the Noticed Alternative Route.  
HMLP determined that the Preferred Route is superio r to the Noticed Alternative Route 
from a construction noise perspective because it wi ll be incrementally less impactful and 
because the Preferred Route is adjacent to more com mercial, industrial and institutional 
land uses, while the Noticed Alternative is located  adjacent to more dense residential 
neighborhoods. 
Impact Mitigation 
Noise from cable splicing operations would be minim ized through use of specialized low-
sound equipment such as low-noise generators, and by reducing or eliminating the use of 
motorized equipment during evening and overnight wo rk.  Other potential mitigation 
measures include use of a low-noise/muffled generat or, portable sound walls (temporary 
noise barriers) as needed, blocking the path of gen erators, and working with the Towns 
to coordinate work. 
5.5.10 Cultural Resources 
HMLP undertook a cultural resource investigation to  identify historic and archaeological 
resources adjacent to the underground segments of t he Preferred Route and the Noticed 
Alternative Route.  To be considered significant an d eligible for listing on the State or 
National Registers of Historic Places, a cultural r esource must exhibit physical integrity 
and contribute to American history, architecture, archaeology, technology, or culture. 
The Project is subject to review by the MHC in comp liance with G.L. c. 9, §§ 26-27C as 
amended by Chapter 254 of the Acts of 1988 (950 CMR 71.00).  HMLP undertook a cultural

resources investigation to identify previously reco rded historic and archaeological 
resources adjacent to the Preferred Route and Noticed Alternative Route.  This assessment 
included review of MHC files and MACRIS.

There are 116 historic sites and 2 historic distric ts along the Preferred Route inventoried 
within MHC’s MACRIS database.  The two historic districts are: 
• Central Square Historic District (NRDIS) 
• Jackson Square (Not National Register District) 
There is one inventoried point, the Washington Scho ol Professional Building located at 8 
School Street in Weymouth, which is included in the  National Register of Historic Places 
(NRHP).  This property is adjacent to both the Pref erred Route and Noticed Alternative 
Route. 
Noticed Alternative Route 
There are 69 historic sites and 1 historic district  along the Noticed Alternative Route 
inventoried within MHC’s MACRIS database.  The historic district is: 
• Jackson Square (Not National Register District) 
As previously described, the Washington School Prof essional Building is included in the 
NRHP and is adjacent to the Noticed Alternative Rou te. No other NRHP-listed properties 
are adjacent to the Noticed Alternative Route.  The  variation is adjacent to 94 historic 
sites. 
Comparison 
The Preferred Route traverses near more inventoried sites and intersects more inventoried 
historic areas than the Noticed Alternative Route.  However, as the Project involves the 
underground installation of a transmission line wit hin the existing paved limits of 
roadways, neither route is anticipated to result in impacts to historic resources.

Impact Mitigation 
The proposed transmission line is not anticipated to result in impacts to cultural resources 
and therefore mitigation for cultural resource impa cts is not proposed.  A Project 
Notification Form was submitted to MHC, and the Pet itioners are coordinating with the 
MHC to conduct field investigations on previously undeveloped portions of the Weymouth 
Tap Station and Hobart Substation II sites and will  continue to coordinate with MHC on 
the results of this investigation.  Potential effec ts and associated mitigation, if any, to 
historic and archaeological resources will be addressed with the MHC through Section 106 
of the National Historic Preservation Act and the State Review processes. 
5.5.11 Land Use, Environmental and Cultural Resources Impacts 
Analysis Conclusion 
Table 5-14 provides a comparison of the route alter natives based on the evaluation of 
land use, environmental and cultural resources criteria.  The Preferred Route and Noticed 
Alternative Route were determined to be comparable on a number of criteria.  The 
Preferred Route is adjacent to fewer residential pr operties than the Noticed Alternative 
Route.  Due to these attributes of the Preferred Ro ute, the Preferred Route is superior 
with regard to the Land Use, Wetlands and Water Res ources, and Noise criteria. The 
Noticed Alternative is superior with regard to the Potential for Traffic Congestion criterion.  
Both routes are comparable with regard to the Poten tial for Subsurface Contamination, 
Public Shade Trees, Cultural Resources, Visual and EMF criteria.  The impacts associated 
with Wetlands and Water Resources along the Preferr ed Route and Noticed Alternative 
Route will be mitigated by limiting work within previously disturbed areas and through the 
coordination with other proposed construction proje cts, to the extent practicable, along 
the route.  Therefore, based on this impact assessment, the Preferred Route is superior.

5.6 Cost Comparison 
The Proposed Route and Noticed Alternative Route both have similar designs.  Both routes 
have the same New Tap Station design and New Substa tion design. The cable and duct 
system are similar in design specifications.  Therefore, the only cost element that changes 
between the two routes is the length of the cables and duct bank.  Information outlined 
in Table 4-8 shows the total costs for each of the Candidate Routes. As further described 
within that table, the transmission only cost for t he Preferred Route is $47.7M, whereas 
the Notice Alternative transmission only cost is $49.2M, a difference in cost of $1.5M. 
5.7 Reliability Comparison 
The Proposed Route and Noticed Alternative Route both have similar designs.  Both routes 
have the same New Tap Station design and New Substa tion. For both routes, the cable 
and duct system are similar in design specification s, duct bank configuration, as well as 
the system protection elements to remove the underg round cable from service in the 
event of a fault. The system design is consistent w ith Good Utility Practice as it relates 
design and construction for electrical systems at t his voltage class.  They are both 
considered “Short Transmission lines” in transmissi on line terminology, and therefore, 
there is no significant difference in reliability b etween the Proposed Route and Notice 
Alternative Route. 
5.8 Overall Comparison of Preferred Route and Notic ed 
Alternative Route 
All work proposed at the Weymouth Tap Station and Hobart II Substation creates minimal 
impacts for both the Preferred Route and the Notice d Alternative Route.  Therefore, this 
was not a factor in HMLP’s route selection.  The Pr eferred Route and the Noticed 
Alternative Route have similar and relatively minim al environmental effects, and the 
majority of those effects will be temporary and can  be minimized using mitigation 
measures.   
The Preferred Route was determined to be roughly similar to the Noticed Alternative Route 
on the basis of cost, environmental impacts and rel iability.  HMLP had extensive 
consultations with Town of Weymouth and Town of Hin gham officials and held multiple 
open houses during the routing analysis.  Town of W eymouth officials indicated that the 
timing of the projects is important, as there are p lans to construct street improvements 
along Lake Street prior to the construction of the proposed Transmission Line. In addition, 
there are more residences along Lake Street, includ ing Environmental Justice housing 
units directly adjacent to the Lake Street Routes.  Regarding the Broad Street route, there 
is proposed redevelopment within Jackson Square.  I nput received from open houses 
indicates a concern along the Broad Street Route for impacts to traffic along Broad Street 
during construction.  While the Broad Street Route is the Preferred Route, HMLP is 
prepared to move forward with either the Broad Street Route or the Lake Street Route.  
HMLP will work closely with the Towns and area neig hborhoods to ensure that temporary 
construction impacts are minimized and that the New Line is installed in the least impactful 
way possible.

Consistency with the Current Health, 
Environmental Protection, and Resource 
Use and Development Policies of the 
Commonwealth 
6.1 Introduction and Standards of Review 
Among other things, G.L. c. 164, § 69J states that the Siting Board shall approve a petition 
to construct a facility if it determines that “plan s for expansion and construction of the 
applicant’s new facilities are consistent with current health, environmental protection, and 
resource use and development policies as adopted by  the Commonwealth.”  As set forth 
in this Section, the proposed Project satisfies this provision of Section 69J and also is fully 
consistent with other important state energy polici es as articulated in the Electric Utility 
Restructuring Act of 1997 (the “Restructuring Act”) , the Green Communities Act (c. 169 
of the Acts of 2008), the Global Warming Solutions Act (c. 298 of the Acts of 2008), the 
Energy Diversity Act (c. 188 of the Acts of 2016), the Clean Energy Act (c. 227 of the Acts 
of 2018), and An Act Creating a Next Generation Roa dmap for Massachusetts Climate 
Policy (c. 8 of the Acts of 2021).  
6.2 Health Policies 
The Restructuring Act provides that reliable electr ic service is of “utmost importance to 
the safety, health and welfare of the Commonwealth’ s citizens and economy…”  See 
Restructuring Act § 1(h).  The Legislature has expressly determined that an adequate and 
reliable supply of energy is critical to the state’ s citizens and economy.  The Siting Board 
has determined that projects that increase reliabil ity in electric service to the community 
also can play a role to contribute to the health of the Commonwealth’s citizens.  Eversource 
Mid-Cape  at 89-90; Sudbury-Hudson  at 188.  
The Project will be fully consistent with these pol icies and Siting Board precedent.  As 
discussed in Section 2 of this Petition, the Project is needed for reliability purposes because 
the entire Town of Hingham presently is susceptible  to an extended outage in the event 
of N-1 and N-1-1 contingencies.  Unlike large investor-owned utilities, which typically have 
multiple substations within an area and can backsto p their customer circuits via 
distribution tie circuits from other substations, H MLP is limited to one substation.  There 
are no other backstop transmission or distribution options available to HMLP, and one N-
1 event would interrupt power to the Town for an extended period of time due to the lack 
of switching alternatives.  Similarly, an outage ev ent or maintenance requirement that 
takes one of the two circuits supplying HMLP out of service for an extended duration could 
result in loss of service to the entire town if the  second remaining transmission line were 
to experience an outage event ( i.e ., an N-1-1 contingency).  No backstop transmission or 
distribution options are available to HMLP which wo uld prevent N-1-1 events from 
interrupting power to the Town for an extended peri od of time.  As such, the Project is 
critical to ensuring an adequate and reliable suppl y of electricity to the citizens and 
businesses of Hingham and of utmost importance to public safety, health and welfare.

Moreover, HMLP and Eversource will design, construc t, and maintain the facilities 
comprising this Project in a manner to ensure that the health and safety of the public are 
protected.  HMLP and Eversource will comply with al l applicable federal, state, and local 
regulations, and industry standards and guidelines established for protection of the public.  
As discussed in Section 5 of the Analysis, all design, construction, and operation activities 
will be in accordance with applicable governmental and industry standards.   
6.3 Environmental Protection Policies 
HMLP and Eversource will obtain all environmental a pprovals and permits required by 
federal, state, and local agencies and will constru ct and operate the Project in full 
compliance with applicable federal, state, and muni cipal statutes, regulations, and 
environmental policies.  As such, the Project will contribute to a reliable, low cost, diverse 
energy supply for the Commonwealth while avoiding, minimizing, and mitigating 
environmental impacts to the maximum extent practic able.  Table 6-1 identifies the 
anticipated permits, reviews, and approvals require d for the Project (not including the 
Siting Board’s review).  By virtue of satisfying the requirements for obtaining each of these 
federal, state, and local permits and approvals, th e Project will comply with applicable 
state and local environmental policies.

6.3.1 The Restructuring Act 
The Restructuring Act requires HMLP to demonstrate that the Project minimizes 
environmental impacts consistent with the minimizat ion of costs associated with 
avoidance, minimization, and mitigation of the envi ronmental impacts of the Project.  
Accordingly, an assessment of all impacts of a proposed project is necessary to determine 
whether an appropriate balance is achieved both amo ng conflicting environmental 
concerns as well as among environmental impacts, co st, and reliability.  A project that 
achieves the appropriate balance meets the requirement in G.L. c. 164, § 69J to minimize 
environmental impacts at the lowest possible cost.  
To determine if a petitioner has achieved the prope r balance among environmental 
impacts, cost and reliability, the Siting Board first determines if the petitioner has provided 
sufficient information regarding environmental impacts and potential mitigation measures. 
The Siting Board then determines whether environmental impacts are avoided, minimized, 
and mitigated to the maximum extent possible.  Simi larly, the Siting Board evaluates 
whether the petitioner has demonstrated that the pr oject is needed and has provided 
sufficient cost information in order to determine i f the appropriate balance among

environmental impacts, cost, and reliability has been achieved.  In Sections 3, 4, and 5 of 
this Analysis, HMLP has demonstrated that it compar ed a range of alternative projects, 
potential substation and tap station site and transmission line route options, and proposed 
specific plans to avoid, minimize and mitigate envi ronmental impacts associated with the 
construction, operation, and maintenance of the proposed New Line, New Substation and 
New Tap Station, consistent with cost minimization.   Accordingly, the proposed Project is 
consistent with the environmental policies of the C ommonwealth as set forth in the 
Restructuring Act. 
6.3.2 State and Local Environmental Policies 
As noted in Table 6-1 above, HMLP and Eversource will obtain all environmental approvals 
and permits required by federal, state, and local a gencies and will construct and operate 
the Project to comply fully with applicable federal , state, and municipal regulations and 
environmental policies.  Thus, the Project will enh ance the reliability of the HMLP electric 
system while avoiding, minimizing, and mitigating environmental impacts to the maximum 
extent practicable.  By meeting the requirements for acquiring each of these federal, state, 
and local permits, the Project will comply with app licable federal, state and local 
environmental policies. 
6.3.3 The Green Communities Act 
The Green Communities Act encourages energy and bui lding efficiency, promotes 
renewable energy, creates green communities, implem ents elements of the Regional 
Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and provides market ince ntives and funding for various types 
of energy generation.  The Green Communities Act (as amended and supplemented by St. 
2012, c. 209, An Act Relative to Competitively Pric ed Electricity) has resulted in greater 
renewable supplies and substantial new conservation  initiatives since enactment and 
continuing in future years. 
 
The proposed Project will address a significant exi sting reliability issue in the Town of 
Hingham and ensure reliability of the Town’s electr icity supply for years to come.  While 
the proposed Project is needed to meet reliability standards, given the climate change 
goals of both the Town of Hingham and the Commonwealth, HMLP determined that it was 
reasonable and prudent to select a substation site and lay out its proposed substation to 
accommodate a new transformer and switchgear when l oad warrants these additions.  
HMLP has estimated the technical potential for syst em peak winter load with full 
electrification and that winter peak exceeds the cu rrent system capability.  Thus, while 
not needed for capacity purposes in the near-term, the proposed Project offers the distinct 
benefit of addressing peak winter load over the long term in the high electrification case.   
 
Moreover, the proposed Project will enable HMLP to continue to integrate clean energy 
generated by renewable sources, support electrifica tion projects in Town, and 
accommodate increased usage of electric vehicles an d the associated installation of 
electric charging stations, consistent with the Green Communities Act.    
 
Accordingly, the proposed Project will meet the identified need in a reliable, cost-effective, 
and environmentally benign manner and therefore, is  consistent with the Green 
Communities Act.

6.3.4 The Global Warming Solutions Act 
The Global Warming Solutions Act (“GWSA”) establish es aggressive greenhouse gas 
(“GHG”) emissions reduction targets of 25 percent f rom 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 
percent from 1990 levels by 2050.  Pursuant to the GWSA, the Secretary of the EOEEA 
issued the Clean Energy & Climate Plan for 2020 in December 2010 and updated the plan 
in December 2015.  Among other provisions, the GWSA obligates administrative agencies 
such as the Siting Board, in considering and issuin g permits, to consider reasonably 
foreseeable climate change impacts (e.g., additiona l GHG emissions) and related effects 
(e.g., sea level rise).  In April 2020, the EOEEA S ecretary established a 2050 statewide 
emissions limit of net zero greenhouse gas emission s (and in no event greater than 85% 
below 1990 levels).  Then, in December 2020, the Se cretary issued the Massachusetts 
2050 Decarbonization Roadmap that calls for increas ed electrification (e.g., electric 
vehicles, electric home heating, new heat pump tech nologies), new local renewable 
resources (e.g., wind, solar and battery storage), and the delivery of power from remote 
clean energy resources, such as offshore wind. 
Additionally, the GWSA amended MEPA to require that  agencies, departments, boards, 
commissions, and authorities, in considering and is suing permits, licenses, and other 
administrative approvals and decisions, consider re asonably foreseeable climate change 
impacts, including additional GHG emissions, and effects, such as predicted sea level rise.  
In response, in 2010, MEPA issued the Massachusetts  Environmental Policy Act GHG 
Emissions Policy and Protocol (“GHG Policy”), which  requires that projects undergoing 
review under MEPA quantify the project's GHG emissions and identify measures to avoid, 
minimize, or mitigate such emissions. The GHG Policy also requires proponents to quantify 
the impact of proposed mitigation in terms of emissions and energy savings. 
On March 26, 2021, former Governor Baker signed the  Roadmap Act into law.  The 
Roadmap Act codified the Administration’s commitmen t to net-zero emissions by 2050 
and advances and extends the goals of the GWSA by e stablishing new interim goals for 
emissions reductions and authorizing a voluntary en ergy efficient building code for 
municipalities.   
HMLP’s proposed Project is fully consistent with the policies established by the GWSA and 
Roadmap Act.  GHG emissions associated with the Pro ject will be de minimis during the 
construction phase, and short-term localized air qu ality effects will be minimal.   The 
proposed Project will have no adverse climate chang e impacts or adverse effects on sea 
levels.  Rather, the proposed Project is needed to maintain reliability of service for the 
Town of Hingham and enable HMLP to meet regional re liability standards.  Additionally, 
while not needed for capacity purposes in the near- term, the proposed Project offers the 
distinct benefit of addressing peak winter load over the long term in the high electrification 
case.  As such, the proposed Project will enable HMLP to continue to integrate clean energy 
generated by renewables sources, support electrific ation projects in Town, and 
accommodate increased usage of electric vehicles an d the associated installation of 
electric charging stations.
 
The Project as designed is consistent with both the  Commonwealth’s requirements for 
siting of electric facilities as well as future sta te and local planning initiatives.  
Consequently, the Project is consistent with the GWSA and the Roadmap Act.

6.3.5 Energy Diversity Act and Clean Energy Act 
On August 8, 2016, former Governor Baker signed into law the Energy Diversity Act, which 
facilitates the procurement and integration of rene wable energy generation resources, 
including new offshore wind energy generation, firm service hydroelectric generation, and 
a new class of renewable energy facilities that meet eligibility criteria. 
On August 9, 2018, former Governor Baker signed int o law the Clean Energy Act, which 
amends the Energy Diversity Act to further encourage energy storage efforts and requires 
the Department of Energy Resources to investigate t he potential for additional clean 
energy solicitations. 
The Project will improve the reliability of HMLP’s transmission system, and also will allow 
HMLP to continue to integrate clean energy resource s, such as solar, wind and battery 
storage, support electrification projects in Town, and accommodate increased usage of 
electric vehicles and the associated installation of electric charging stations.  Accordingly, 
the Project is consistent with the Energy Diversity  Act as amended by the Clean Energy 
Act. 
6.4 Environmental Justice Policies 
The Roadmap Act brought new focus to environmental justice by defining environmental 
justice populations and environmental burden, and b y charging agencies of the 
Commonwealth to meaningfully involve all people in decisions and policies and to consider 
the equitable distribution of environmental benefit s and burdens.  These EJ principles 
support protection from environmental pollution and the ability to live in and enjoy a clean 
and healthy environment, regardless of race, color,  income, class, handicap, gender 
identity, sexual orientation, national origin, ethnicity or ancestry, religious belief or English 
language proficiency.  
The EOEEA Environmental Justice Policy (updated June 24, 2021) charged EOEEA agencies 
to develop strategies for considering environmental justice in decisions and policies.  HMLP 
and Eversource engaged in enhanced public outreach with intent to engage environmental 
justice populations and evaluate environmental burdens.   
The Preferred and Noticed Alternative Routes cross through areas within Weymouth 
mapped as environmental justice populations as defi ned by minority status and income 
status, as defined by the Roadmap Act.  Review of t he Massachusetts EJ mapper – 
languages spoken map – indicates that there are no census tracts within one mile of the 
project where at least 5% of the population are spe akers who report they do not speak 
English "very well".   
HMLP and Eversource conducted numerous in-person an d Zoom meetings to provide 
opportunities to EJ populations and others potentia lly impacted by the Project to learn 
more about the Project and provide their comments and input.  Open houses were held at 
different times of the day in accessible locations and were generally well attended.  A 
Zoom Open House was also held to reach people who were unable to attend in person.  
Eversource researched languages spoken within the U nion Towers population, and 
provided a Cantonese interpreter on site that was u tilized by seven residents. Materials

were distributed in English and Traditional Chinese  and were also made available in 
Spanish.  The focus of these meetings was on the Tap Station, and HMLP representatives 
were in attendance to address questions and comments on the transmission line.  
Eversource hosted an additional meeting at the Cros sroads Worship Center, which is 
located across Broad Street from the Tap Station si te.  Although Spanish and Portuguese 
interpreters were present, there were no interpreta tion needs identified in advance, and 
materials were available in English, Portuguese, Tr aditional Chinese and Spanish. The 
focus of this Open House was on the Tap Station, an d HMLP representatives were in 
attendance to address questions and comments on the transmission line.   
Information on the project is also available on the  HEIRP website ( www.HEIRP.com ).  
Projects updates are posted on this site, and there  is link on the website that people can 
use to provide feedback to HMLP.  HMLP will continu e to communicate status updates on 
the project, offering opportunities for public inpu t throughout the siting, permitting and 
construction phases.   
The proposed project involves the construction of a  new tap station in Weymouth, a 
substation in Hingham, and a 115kV transmission lin e linking the two stations. 
28   The 
Project does not generate energy, nor does it resul t in any industrial discharges.  HMLP 
looked at several alternatives to the Project, as summarized in Section 3, and as there are 
no existing transmission lines for HMLP to tap into  within Hingham, impacts to the 
neighboring Town of Weymouth are unavoidable.  HMLP  analyzed several sites for both 
the Weymouth Tap Station and Hobart II Substation, and chose locations that were 
adjacent to existing infrastructure and away from r esidences to minimize the 
environmental burden.  The Weymouth Tap Station sit e is located in an area mapped as 
Environmental Justice for the income criteria.  As noted previously, the site is adjacent to 
existing electrical transmission infrastructure and  the Tap Station has been sited away 
from residences.  
The new transmission line will be underground, and the primary impact of the project will 
be related to construction, similar to other underg round infrastructure projects (e.g., 
water, sewer, stormwater).  Underground infrastruct ure is prevalent throughout 
Massachusetts and within the project area.  The pur pose of the proposed project is to 
provide a reliable energy source to HMLP’s customer s.  Due to the limitations of the 
existing electric grid locations, the Project needs to cross Weymouth to reach Hingham.   
HMLP has designed the Project to minimize the Proje ct’s impacts to all populations, 
including EJ populations.  HMLP has undertaken, and  will continue to undertake, ongoing 
community outreach in EJ communities in or adjacent  to the Project area to facilitate the 
meaningful opportunity to participate by all. The c ontinued outreach to EJ communities 
will be consistent with the Roadmap Act and the rul es and protocols promulgated 
thereunder. As such, the Project is consistent with  the Commonwealth’s EJ policies as 
codified in the Roadmap Act. 
  
 
28   As set out in Section 5.5.1.3, the Project does n ot trigger review under MEPA.

6.5 Resource Use and Development Policies 
The Project, which will ensure the reliability of H MLP’s transmission system, will be 
constructed and operated in compliance with Massach usetts’s policies regarding resource 
use and development.  For example, in 2007, the EOE EA’s Smart Growth/Smart Energy 
policy established the Commonwealth’s Sustainable Development Principles, including: (1) 
supporting the revitalization of city centers and neighborhoods by promoting development 
that is compact, conserves land, protects historic resources and integrates uses; (2) 
encouraging remediation and reuse of existing sites , structures and infrastructure rather 
than new construction in undeveloped areas; and (3) protecting environmentally sensitive 
lands, natural resources, critical habitats, wetlan ds and water resources and cultural and 
historic landscapes.   
As described more fully in Section 5 of this Analys is, the Project will support these 
principles because, among other reasons, the New Su bstation, New Tap Station and New 
Line will be located within previously disturbed pa rcels of land and public ways 
respectively.  In addition, as set forth in Section  4, in selecting a route for the New Line 
and a location for the New Substation, HMLP employed a site and route selection process 
which highly disfavored Open Space and Article 97 l and.  Accordingly, the Project is in 
compliance with, and furthers, the Commonwealth’s p olicies regarding resource use and 
development and does not result in the loss of Article 97 lands.

TOWN OF HINGHAM 
Community Planning  
 
 
 
MEMORANDUM 
 
TO:  Tom Mayo, Town Administrator 
CC:  Tom Morahan, General Manager 
FROM:  Emily Wentworth, Community Planning Director, Michael Silveira, Senior Planner, and 
Jennifer Oram, Zoning Administrator/Senior Planner 
DATE:  June 25, 2024 
RE: Board Recommendations for Proposed Substation at 0 Old Hobart Street 
______________________________________________________________________________________ 
The Planning Board and Zoning Board of Appeals recently reviewed proposed plans to locate a public utility 
building enclosing an electric substation and related site work on a portion of the Hingham Transfer Station 
property at 0 Old H obart Street (Assessors Map 106, Lot 4)  during a joint meeting held on June 4, 2024 . 
Though the review was informal in nature, th e meeting was advertised in a local public publication and 
abutters were noticed.  
 
Article 26 of the 2022 Annual Town Meeting  authorized the Select Board to transfer to the Hingham 
Municipal Lighting Plant (HMLP) the care, custody, management, and control of the northeast corner of the 
property for the construction and operation of the new electrical substation. Article 26 also authorized the 
Select Board to include terms and conditions deemed in the best interest of the Town  in any agreements 
or documents necessary to transfer the parcel.  
 
Section III-A, 3.10 of the Hingham Zoning By-Law allows public utility buildings and structures in the Official 
and Open Space District by a special permit administered by the Zoning Board. Based on the proposed level 
of disturbance associated with the project, Site Plan Revie w under Section I -I would also typically be 
required by the Planning Board. However, MGL c. 40A, s. 3 provides an exemption for certain public utilities 
that reads in part: 
 
Lands or structures used, or to be used by a public service corporation may be exempted in particular 
respects from the operation of a zoning ordinance or by -law if, upon petition of the corporation … 
the department of public utilities shall, after notice given pursuant to section eleven and public 
hearing in the town or city, determine the exemptions required and find that the present or proposed 
use of the land or structure is reasonably necessary for the convenience or welfare of the public; 
provided however, that if lands or structures used or to be used by a public service corporation are 
located in more than one municipality such lands or structures may be exempted in particular 
respects from the operation of any zoning ordinance or by-law if, upon petition of the corporation… 
the department of public utilities shall after notice to all affected communities and public hearing in 
one of said municipalities, determine the exemptions required and find that the present or proposed 
use of the land or structure is reasonably necessary for the convenience or welfare of the public.

While HMLP is pursuing a utility project zoning exemption through the Department of Public Utilities (DPU) 
from certain local zoning requirements, the informal review provided both Boards, as well as members of 
the public, to discuss the project and offer feedback regarding the plan. The Boards voted unanimously to 
recommend that the Select Board consider imposition of the following conditions when transferring 
custody of the parcel to HMLP: 
 
1. Pre-Construction Meeting. A preconstructi on review meeting with inspection of the erosion 
control installation and marked limits of clearing shall be required before issuance of a building 
permit. 
 
2. Limits of Work. During clearing and/or construction activities, the marked limit of work shall be 
maintained until all construction work is completed and the site is cleaned up. All vegetation 
beyond the limit of work shall be retained in an undisturbed state and no sto ckpiling of topsoil 
or storage of fill, materials, or equipment may occur within the protected area. 
 
3. Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP). Since the overall project will disturb more than 
one acre, the Applicant shall submit a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan to the Community 
Planning Department a minimum of three weeks prior to the start of any work. The Select Board 
may require, at the applicant’s expense, the establishment of a consultant fee account to fund 
the cost of the SWPPP review. 
 
4. Construction Schedule. At least three weeks prior to the start of any work, the Applicant shall 
provide a construction schedule and traffic management plan to the Community Planning 
Department and Department of Public Works . Said construction schedule and traffic 
management plan shall incorporate assurance that major deliveries and site work will minimize 
disruption to the transfer station operations. 
 
5. Construction Vehicles. All construction vehicles shall be parked onsite. No construction vehicles 
shall enter the premises before 7 AM on any given construction day. 
 
6. Inspections. Inspections shall be required during construction, and prior to issuance of a 
certificate of occupancy, of all elements of the project related to or affecting erosion control, 
limits of work, and the approved drainage and stormwater system installed for the project. The 
Select Board may require, at the applicant’s expense, the establishment of a consultant fee 
account to fund the cost of such inspections. 
 
7. As-Built Plan Requirement. Upon project completion an as-built plan must be submitted to the 
Building Commissioner prior to the issuance  of a certificate of occupancy. In addition to such 
other requirements as are imposed by the Building Commissioner, the as -built plan must 
demonstrate substantial conformance with the stormwater system design and performance 
standards of the approved project plans.

1 Introduction and Summary 
Hingham Municipal Light ing Plant (HMLP), a municipally owned electric utility, proposes to construct 
and operate a new underground 115-kilovolt (kV) transmission line and substation in the Town of Hingham, 
Massachusetts (Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project (HEIRP) ).  Currently, HMLP, which 
provides electricity to all customers in the Town of Hingham, is served by a single bulk power substation 
known as "Hobart Substation", located at 190 Old Hobart Street in Hingham, adjacent to the Town landfill 
and recycling center.  HMLP’s current substation and distribution system is designed to allow for loss of a 
single 115/13.8 kV transformer while still retaining the capability to serve the highest load demand of the 
Town.  Hobart Substation currently is fed via two overhead 115-kV transmission lines covering a distance 
of approximately 3.3 miles, which are supported by both wood and metal structures, including 22 double -
circuit towers (DCTs), where the two transmission lines share the same single pole.  This configuration is  
susceptible to contingency events that can result in simultaneous loss of service from both transmission 
lines.  If even a single DCT pole supporting the two lines falls or is otherwise disabled, service to Hobart 
Substation would be interrupted and all customers within the town of Hingham would be subjected to an 
extended outage.  An extended outage could also occur if one transmission line is out of service for 
maintenance and there is an outage event on the remaining transmission line.  Unlike larger distribution 
systems, there are no alternative supply options available to restore customers from another substation. 
Consequently, loss of service to Hobart Substation results in loss of electrical service to the entire town. 
 
Based on the conditions noted above, HMLP has concluded that, due to the reliability of service concerns 
identified, there is an existing need to mitigate the potential for loss of service in Hingham and has proposed 
the HEIRP .  The total length of the HEIRP Preferred Route, referred to as the Broad Street Route, is 
approximately 17,000 linear feet (about 3.2 miles).  This route exits the proposed Hobart II Substation in 
Hingham and runs west on Hobart Street, turns south on French Street, then turns west on High Street and 
continues west into Weymouth on High Street which becomes Broad Street.   Broad Street is followed for 
approximately 8,500 feet  and includes a crossing of Herring Run Brook,  until ending at the proposed 
Eversource tap station site at the Eversource Right -of-Way (ROW) in Weymouth.  Existing road widths 
range from 25 feet (French and Hobart Street) to 40 feet (Broad Street), and the predominant adjacent land 
use is residential, with some commercial and industrial.  There is also a Noticed Alternative Route, referred 
to as the Lake Street Route, that also follows a combination of main and side streets for a slightly longer 
total length of approximately 19,600 linear feet (3.7 miles). 
 
Tighe & Bond requested that Gradient perform an independent electric and magnetic field (EMF) 
assessment for the proposed underground 115- kV circuit to be construct ed and operated as part of the 
HEIRP.  This EMF assessment is focused on aboveground 60-Hertz (Hz) alternating current (AC) magnetic 
fields (MFs) that will be generated by the underground 115-kV circuit  because there are no aboveground 
electric fields for underground transmissions lines due to their shielding by the metallic shield covering the 
conductor insulation, the duct banks, and the intervening earth.  The MF modeling analysis is focused on 
representative cross sections for the new underground 115-kV circuit and not any equipment (e.g., busbars, 
transformers, switchgear) within the fencelines of either the new substation to be located on the Hingham 
transfer station site or the new Eversource tap station  to be located off of Broad Street  at the Eversource 
ROW in Weymouth.  The proposed Hobart II Substation in Hingham  will have gas-insulated switchgear 
(GIS), which will allow the conductors within the proposed substation to be placed closer together than for 
air-insulated switchgear (AIS), enhancing the rapid drop-off of MF levels with distance away from the 
equipment.  It is thus expected that MFs outside the fenceline of the new substation will be dominated by 
MFs associated with the Project underground 115-kV transmission line and other transmission or 

--- PAGE 207 ---
   2 
 
 
distribution lines entering/exiting the station rather than equipment within the substation fenceline.  While 
AIS is to be used at the new Weymouth tap station, MFs will also diminish rapidly with distance from the 
tap station equipment, and the tap station will  not abut any residential properties  (note that the closest 
residential properties on Broad Street are in closer proximity to the Project underground 115- kV 
transmission line than the tap station, and the Project underground line would thus be expected to be a larger 
potential source of MFs at these properties than the more distant tap station; while the closest residences on 
Roosevelt Road are on the other side of the Eversource ROW from the tap station, so that the tap station 
would be expected to be a negligible source of MFs at these properties) .  In addition, engineering design 
diagrams indicate that the closest tap station switchgear to the paved parking lot at the Connell Rink and 
Pool is to be located more than 50 feet from the parking lot  edge, such that MFs  from the tap station 
equipment will have diminished to minimal levels.   
 
MF modeling was conducted at a height of 1 meter (3.28 feet) above the ground surface for four  
representative underground line cross sections, including (1) the triangular conductor configuration for the 
typical underground duct bank trenches, (2) the horizontal conductor configuration for flat trenches, (3) the 
vertical conductor configuration for manhole (e.g., splice vault)  approaches, and (4) the horizontal 
directional drilling (HDD) bore conductor configuration for the crossing beneath  Herring Run Broo k in 
Weymouth.  MF modeling was conducted for both annual average and system peak load levels for each 
cross section.  The MF modeling did not consider the  weaker currents that will be induced on the ground 
continuity conductor (GCC) to be installed in the underground  duct banks in proximity to the phase 
conductors.  Because this induced current on the GCC will generally have small canceling effects on the 
aboveground MFs from the phase conductors , th e neglect of the induced currents on the GCC  will 
contribute towards a conservative overestimation of the model-predicted MFs.     
 
As discussed in more detail in Section 2 of this report, a number of national and international health and 
safety organizations have developed EMF exposure guidelines or limits designed to protect humans against 
any adverse health effects.  The limit values should not be viewed as demarcation lines between "safe" and 
"dangerous" levels of EMFs, but rather, levels that assure safety with adequate margin s to allow for 
uncertainties in the science.  For magnetic fields, these health -based guidelines range from about 1,000 to 
10,000 milligauss (mG).  The International Commission on Non- Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) 
guideline for allowable public exposure to 60-Hz AC MFs is 2,000 mG (ICNIRP, 2010).  Section 2 also 
describes EMF guidelines that have been adopted by various states in the United States (US), including by 
the Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board (MA EFSB).  These state guidelines are not health-effect 
based and have typically been adopted to maintain the status quo  for EMF le vels on and near  overhead 
transmission line ROWs.  
 
As described in this report and summarized in Tables 1.1 and 1.2 below, our MF modeling analysis showed 
that all modeled post-Project MF values for each representative cross section at both annual average and 
system peak load levels, including directly above the circuit centerlines, are well below the ICNIRP health-
based guideline of 2,000 mG for allowable public exposure to magnetic fields (ICNIRP, 2010).  This is the 
case despite a conservative modeling approach that did not consider the small reductions in magnetic fields 
from the induced GCC currents.  In all cases, aboveground MF values dropped off rapidly with increasing 
lateral distance from the circuit centerlines ( e.g., 88-93% reductions at lateral distances of ±25 ft from 
circuit centerlines), such that aboveground MF levels decreased to negligible levels at short lateral distances 
beyond the trenches.

In addition, as discussed in Section 3, MFs for the HDD bore installation case where the Project 115-kV 
underground circuit will cross beneath Herring Run Brook in Weymouth are not expected to impact the 
annual migration of river herring to their upstream spawning grounds.

sources, and reports on EMF exposure guidelines.  Section 3 describes the EMF modeling procedures for 
calculating EMF levels as a function of lateral distance from an electric transmission line (or distribution 
line) and provides tabular results and charts for the modeled cross sections.  Section 4 summarizes the 
conclusions, and the reference list provides the references for published literature and exposure guidelines

2 Nature of Electric and Magnetic Fields 
All matter contains electrically charged particles.  Most objects are electrically neutral because positive and 
negative charges are present in equal numbers.  When the balance of electric charges is altered, we 
experience electrical effects.  Common examples are the static electricity attraction between a comb and 
our hair or a static electricity spark after walking on a synthetic rug in the wintertime.  Electrical effects 
occur both in nature and through our society's use of electric power (generation, transmission, and 
consumption). 
 
2.1 Units for EMFs Are Kilovolts Per Meter (kV/m) and Milligauss (mG) 
The electrical tension on utility power lines is expressed in volts or kilovolts (1 kV = 1,000 V).  Voltage is 
the "pressure" of the electricity and can be envisioned as analogous to the pressure of water in a plumbing 
system.  The existence of a voltage difference between power lines and ground results in an electric field 
(EF), usually expressed in units of kilovolts per meter (kV/m).  The size of the EF depends on the line 
voltage, the separation distance between lines and ground, and other factors.   There are no aboveground 
electric fields for underground transmissions lines due to their shielding by the metallic shield covering the 
conductor insulation, the duct banks, and the intervening earth. 
 
Power lines also carry an electric current that creates a MF.  The units for electric current are amperes (A), 
which is a measure of the "flow" of electricity.  Electric current is analogous to the flow of water in a 
plumbing system.  The MF produced by an electric current is usually expressed in units of gauss (G) or 
milligauss (mG) (1 G = 1,000 mG).
1  The size of the MF can be accurately calculated for any location and 
depends on the electric current, the distance to the current-carrying conductor, and other factors. 
 
2.2 There Are Many Natural and Man-made Sources of EMFs 
Everyone experiences a variety of natural and man -made EMFs.  EMF levels can be steady or slowly 
varying (often called direct current [DC] fields), or EMF levels can vary in time (often called alternating 
current [AC] fields).  When the time variation corr esponds to that of standard North American power line 
currents (i.e., 60 cycles per second), the fields are called 60-Hz EMFs, or power-frequency EMFs. 
 
Man-made MFs are common in everyday life.  For example, many childhood toys contain magnets.  Such 
permanent magnets generate strong, steady (DC) MFs.  Typical toy magnets ( e.g., refrigerator door 
magnets) have fields of 100,000-500,000 mG.  On a larger scale, Earth's core also creates a steady DC MF 
that can be easily demonstrated with a compass needle.  The size of the Earth's MF in the northern US is 
about 550 mG (less than 1% of the levels generated by typical refrigerator door magnets). 
 
2.3 Power-frequency EMFs Are Found Near Electric Lines and Appliances 
In North America, electric power transmission lines, distribution lines, and electrical  wiring in buildings  
and homes carry AC currents and voltages that change size and direction at a frequency of 60 Hz.  These 
60-Hz currents and voltages create 60 -Hz EMFs nearby.  The size of the MF is proportional to the line 
 
1 Another unit for magnetic field (MF) levels is the microtesla (μT) (1 μT = 10 mG). 

--- PAGE 210 ---
   5 
 
 
current, while the size of the EF is proportional to the line voltage.  The EMFs associated with electrical 
wires and electrical equipment decrease rapidly with increasing distance away from the electrical wires.  
Specifically, EMFs from three -phased, balanced conductors decrease in proportion to the square of the 
distance from the conductors (i.e., 1/d2) (IEEE, 2014). 
 
When EMF derives from different wires or conductors that are in close proximity, or adjacent to one 
another, the level of the net EMF produced will be somewhere in the range between the sum of EMF from 
the individual sources and the difference of the EMF from the individual sources.  EMF may partially add, 
or partially cancel but, because adjacent wires are often carrying current in opposite directions, the EMF 
produced in such a case tends generally to cancel. 
 
EMFs in the home arise from electric appliances, indoor wiring, grounding currents on pipes and ground 
wires, and outdoor distribution or transmission circuits.  Inside residences, typical baseline 60-Hz MF levels 
(away from appliances) range from 0.5-5.0 mG. 
 
Higher 60-Hz MF levels are found near operating appliances.  For example, can openers, mixers, blenders, 
refrigerators, fluorescent lamps, electric ranges, clothes washers, toasters, portable heaters, vacuum 
cleaners, electric tools, and many other appliances generate MF levels as high as several hundred mG at 
distances of 1 foot (NIEHS, 2002).  MF levels from small appliances held within half a foot (e.g., shavers, 
hair dryers, vacuum cleaners) can be as high as 600 -700 mG (NIEHS, 2002 ).  At school and in the 
workplace, lights, motors, copy machines, vending machines, video-display terminals, motor-driven pencil 
sharpeners, electric tools, electric heaters, and building wiring are all sources of 60-Hz MFs.   
 
Recognizing that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is primarily a source of DC fields rather than 60 -Hz 
fields, MRIs are a diagnostic procedure that puts humans in much larger, but steady, MF  (e.g., levels of 
20,000,000 mG).  The scanning MF superimposed on the large, steady static field (which is the source of 
the characteristic audio noise of MRI scans) exposes the body to time-varying MF similar to time -varying 
power-frequency MF. 
 
2.4 State, National, and International Guidelines for Power-Frequency EMFs 
Table 2.1 shows guidelines for 60 -Hz AC EMFs from national and world health and safety organizations 
that are designed to be protective against any adverse health effects.  The limit values should not be viewed 
as demarcation lines between safe and dangerous levels of EMF s, but rather, levels that assure safety with 
an adequate margin to allow for uncertainties in the science.   As part of its International EMF Project, the 
World Health Organization (WHO) has conducted comprehensive reviews of EMF health-effects research 
and existing standards and guidelines.  The WHO website for the International EMF Project (WHO, 2023) 
notes:  "[T]he main conclusion from the WHO reviews is that EMF exposures below the limits 
recommended in the ICNIRP international guidelines do not appear to have any known consequence on 
health." 
 
The US has no federal standards limiting either residential or occupational exposure to 60-Hz EMFs.  Table 
2.2 lists 60-Hz AC EMF guidelines that have been adopted by various states in the US , including by the 
MA EFSB.  State guidelines , including  those of the MA EFSB , are not health -effect based and have 
typically been adopted to maintain the status quo for MFs on and near an overhead transmission line ROW.  
The MA EFSB accepted an edge-of-ROW guideline level of 85 mG for MF in the mid-1980s (MA EFSB, 
2009), along with a  corresponding edge-of-ROW electric field guideline level of 1.8 kilovolts per meter 
(kV/m).  While there are references to these guidelines in some older EFSB analyses and decisions on 
transmission line projects, the MA EFSB has put more emphasis on mitigation  of magnetic field impacts 

--- PAGE 211 ---
   6 
 
 
rather than on a specific MF guidance level  in more recent EFSB analyses and decisions on transmission 
line projects.

3 MF Modeling for Project Underground 115 -kV 
Transmission Line 
3.1 MF Modeling Software Program 
The FIELDS computer program, designed by Southern California Edison, was utilized to calculate MF 
levels from the Project underground 115-kV transmission line.  This program operates using Maxwell's 
equations, which accurately apply the laws of physics as related to electricity and magnetism (EPRI, 1982, 
1993).  Modeled fields using this program are both precise and accurate for the input data utilized.  Results 
of the model have been checked extensively against each other and against other software (e.g., CORONA, 
from the Bonneville Power Administration, US Department of Energy) to ensure that the implementation 
of the laws of physics are consistent.  In these validation tests, program results for MF levels were found to 
be in very good agreement with each other (Mamishev and Russell, 1995). 
 
Modeled 60-Hz AC magnetic field levels from FIELDS are reported as root mean square (RMS) values of 
the resultant fields, generally referred to as B
Resultant or BRes, and sometimes as B Product or BProd.  We have 
reported BRes values to be consistent with the magnetic field levels that will be reported by instruments 
relying on three fixed orthogonal coils  (e.g. , fixed -coil instruments like the EMDEX II) , where the 
electronics calculate the sum of the squares of magnetic fields detected by each orthogonal coil separately.  
However, it is important to note that BRes will always be larger than the real "maximum" rotating magnetic 
field (i.e., the RMS value of the semi-major axis magnitude of the field ellipse; known as BMaximum or BMax) 
when modeling (or measuring) elliptically or circularly polarized fields.  In other words, B Res is a 
conservative overestimate of magnetic field values, in particular for elliptically or circularly polarized  
magnetic fields typical of phase conductors in a triangular or "delta" configuration (IEEE, 2021). 
 
3.2 Power-line Loads 
MFs produced by the Project three-phase underground circuit were modeled using both annual average and 
system peak line loadings.  The current per phase satisfies the relationship: 
 
(Eq. 3.1) phaseI V S× × =3  
 
where: 
S = The power in kilovolt-amperes (kVA) 
V = The line voltage in kilovolts (kV) 
Iphase = The current per phase in amperes (A) 
 
Thus, the current per phase conductor is: 
(Eq. 3.2) 
V
SI phase
×
=

Real power is typically expressed  in megawatts (MW) (P ), and apparent power in megavolt -amperes 
(MVA) (S).2,3  To convert between power quoted in MW to MVA, one must divide MW by the power 
factor. 
  
Electric current and voltage values, which were either provided by HMLP or calculated from data provided 
by HMLP, are summarized by load scenario (annual average and system peak loadings) in Table 3.1 for 
use in the post-Project MF modeling analysis.  As indicated by Table 3.1, balanced conductor loadings of 
either 115.5 amps or 286.2 amps were used for the post -Project annual average and system peak load 
scenarios, respectively.

3.3 Project Cable Specifications  and Representative Underground Line Cross 
Sections 
Table 3.2 provides a summary of key technical specifications for the 115-kV transmission cables to be 
installed in underground duct banks along the Project route.  The 115-kV single-core cables will consist of 
a 750 kcmil copper conductor covered by cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) solid insulation and by a 
metallic shield, with an overall cable diameter of 2.9 inches.  The 115-kV circuit will consist of three cables, 
one per phase, each to be installed within  6-inch conduits in the underground duct banks .  A GCC, which 
will consist of a 350 kcmil copper conductor, will also be installed within a 2-inch conduit in close 
proximity to the Project phase conductors.  There will also be smaller conduits for distributed temperature 
sensing (DTS) and communications cables. 
 
MF modeling was performed by Gradient for four  representative Project underground line cross sections .  
Figure 3.1 shows the triangular conductor configuration that will be used for the underground duct banks 
to be installed in the typical duct bank trenches.  As indicated in this diagram, the typical duct bank will be 
approximately 26-inches tall by 31-inches wide, and phase conductors will be installed in two lower 6-inch 
conduits and a single upper conduit.  The duct bank will be encased in a thermal concrete envelope.  Figures 
3.2 through 3.4 show the other three representative cross sections for the underground circuit, including the 
horizontal conductor configuration to be used as needed depending on subsurface conditions for a flat trench 
installation case (Figure 3.2), the vertical conductor configuration to be used for manhole (e.g., splice vault) 
approaches (Figure 3.3), and the HDD bore conductor configuration to be used for crossing beneath Herring 
Run Brook in Weymouth (Figure 3.4).  These figures also show the conduits to be used for the GCC, DTS 
cables, and communications cables.

For each representative underground line cross section shown in Figures 3.1 through 3.4, aboveground MF 
levels were modeled as a function of horizontal distance, perpendicular to the direction of current flow.  MF 
levels were calculated out to 50  feet on either side of the conductor centerline.  Per standard industry 
practices (IEEE Power Engineering Society, 1995a,b), MF levels were modeled at a height of 1 meter above 
the ground surface to represent the exposure of an upright person .  Each phase conductor was assumed to 
lie in the bottom of the 6 -inch polyvinyl chloride ( PVC) conduits (for all but the HDD bore installation 
case) or 8-inch high-density polyethylene (HDPE) conduits (for only the HDD bore installation case), and 
horizontal and vertical coordinates were calculated based on dimensions shown in the cross section 
diagrams and conductor specifications provided by Electrical Consulting Engineers, P.C. (Table 3.2).  The 
current on the Project phase conductors will induce a smaller cur rent on the GCC to be installed in the 
underground duct banks.  However, because the FIELDS model does not calculate either the magnitude or 
phase angle of induced currents, the MF modeling was conducted with the phase conductors' main currents 
only (i.e., it was assumed that the currents on the GCC are zero).  This is a conservatism in the MF modeling 
(i.e., a factor contributing to the overestimation of MFs) because the weak current induced by the MFs from 
the phase conductors' main currents on the GCC is expected to produce an MF that will tend to oppose 
(partially cancel) the MF causing the induced current, similar to the induced current on passive loops used 
as a mitigation measure for underground transmission lines (Istenic et al., 2001).      
 
The MF modeling analysis is focused on representative cross sections for the new underground 115 -kV 
circuit and not any equipment (e.g., busbars, transformers) within the fencelines of either the new substation 
to be located on the Hingham transfer station site or the new Eversource tap station  to be located off of 
Broad Street  adjacent to the Eversource ROW  in Weymouth.  The proposed Hobart II Substation in 
Hingham will have gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) , which will allow the conductors within the propose d 
substation to be placed closer  together than for air -insulated switchgear (AIS) , thus enhancing the rapid 
drop-off of MF levels with distance away from the equipment.  While AIS is to be used at the new 
Eversource tap station, MFs will also diminish rapidly with distance from the tap station equipment and the 
tap station will not abut any residential properties (note that the closest residential properties on Broad 
Street are in closer proximity to the Project underground 115-kV transmission line than the tap station, and 
the Project underground line would thus be expected to be a larger potential source of MFs at these 
properties than the more distant tap station; while the closest residences on Roosevelt Road are on the other 
side of the Eversource ROW from the tap station, so that the tap station would be expected to be a negligible 
source of MFs at these properties).  In addition, engineering design diagrams indicate that the closest 
switchgear to the paved parking lot at the Connell Rink and Pool is to be located more than 50 feet from 
the parking lot edge, such that MFs from the tap station equipment will have diminished to minimal levels.  
It is well-established that, for the types of electrical equipment present in the proposed substation and tap 
station ( e.g., aboveground buswork, transformers, switchgear), where conductors are a rranged in close 
proximity to each other,  that EMF levels decrease rapidly to low levels inside the fenceline;  and the 
strongest fields near the perimeter fence are expected to be associated with the transmission and distribution 
lines entering/exiting the station (IEEE, 2014 ).  As a result, it is expected that MFs outside  the fencelines 
of the new Project substation in Hingham and the new Eversource tap station in Weymouth will be 
dominated by MFs associated with the Project underground 115-kV tr ansmission line  and other 
transmission or distribution lines entering/exiting the stations rather than equipment within the fencelines.

3.4 MF Modeling Results 
Results of the MF modeling for the representative Project 115 -kV underground transmission line cross 
sections are summarized in Tables 3.4 and 3.5, as well as Figures 3.5 through 3.8.  The MF modeling results 
show that all model -predicted MF values, including those directly above the circuit centerlines , are well 
below the ICNIRP health -based guideline of 2,000 mG for allowable public exposure to 60 -Hz AC MFs 
(ICNIRP, 2010).  For the MF modeling based on annual average load  levels, the peak MF level directly 
above the circuit centerline was 14.3 mG for the triangular conductor configuration in  the typical 
underground duct bank trenches, while peak MF levels for the other representative cross sections directly 
above the circuit centerline ranged from 13.2 mG to 31.9 mG.  Slightly higher MF levels were obtained for

the MF modeling based on system peak load levels, with a peak MF level directly above the circuit 
centerline of 35.5 mG for the triangular conductor configuration in the typical underground duct bank 
trenches and a range of 32.6 mG to 78.9 mG for the other representative cross sections.  In all cases, 
aboveground MF values dropped  off rapidly with increasing  lateral distance from the circuit centerlines, 
such that aboveground MF levels decreased to negligible levels at short distances beyond the trenches.  The 
plots show the significant reductions in aboveground MF levels with increasing lateral distance from the 
cables including: 
 
 For the t riangular conductor configuration for the typical underground duct bank trenches, 
approximately 92 percent reductions in aboveground MF levels at lateral distances of ±25 ft  from 
the circuit centerline; 
 For the horizontal conductor configuration for flat trenches , approximately 93 percent reductions 
in aboveground MF levels at lateral distances of ±25 ft from the circuit centerline; 
 For the vertical conductor configuration for manhole approaches , approximately 88 percent 
reductions in aboveground MF levels at lateral distances of ±25 ft from the circuit centerline; 
 For the HDD bore conductor configuration, approximately 90 percent reductions in aboveground 
MF levels at lateral distances of ±25 ft from the circuit centerline.   
 
The HDD bore installation case is to be used for installing the Project cables beneath Herring Run Brook 
in Weymouth, and as indicated in the tables and figures, this installation case was found to have the lowest 
peak aboveground MF levels directly above the circuit centerline due to the greater burial depth (minimum 
of four feet beneath the ground surface) for this installation case.  It is our understanding that some concerns 
have been raised regarding potential impacts of magnetic fields from the Project underground cables on 
river herring (alewife and blueback herring) during their annual migration to upstream spawning grounds 
via Herring Run Brook.  However, it is not established that river herring are either magnetosensitive or rely 
on the earth's geomagnetic field to navigate to their spawning grounds.  For example, the Naisbett -Jones 
and Lohmann (2022) review paper on magnetoreception and magnetic navigation in fish included no 
references to river herring as being among the fish species for which there is evidence of magnetoreception.  
Peer-reviewed journal articles and governmental reports focused on river herring and their migration (e.g., 
Yako et al., 2002; Greene et al ., 2009; Legett et al., 2021; NOAA, 2007 ) make no reference to magnetic 
fields, such as the earth's geomagnetic field, as being among the potential environmental cues involved in 
the mechanism of migration.  Greene et al . (2009) specifically pointed to olfaction as the "primary means 
for homing behavior" for  the alewife herring species.   NOAA (2007) referred to changing water 
temperatures as an initiator of seasonal migrations for alewife herring. 
 
Regardless, even if river herring are in fact magnetosensitive and use the earth's geomagnetic field for 
navigation/migration purposes, the Project 60-Hz AC cables will generate time-varying AC magnetic fields 
that differ from the earth's static ( i.e., steady, 0 Hz) geomagnetic field .  It is not established that 
magnetosensitive marine species, such as salmon, eels, and sharks, which are believed to utilize the earth's 
steady geomagnetic field for navigation and orientation purposes, can detect and respond to 60-Hz AC 
magnetic fields (CSA Ocean Sciences Inc. and Exponent, 2019 ).  Notwithstanding the difference between 
60-Hz AC magnetic fields and steady (0 Hz) magnetic fields, there is also an absence of scientific evidence 
that magnetic field fluctuations could serve as major barriers to migration.  For example, for Chinook 
salmon smolts and adult green sturgeon that have been reported to orient to magnetic fields and that thus 
may use them as a guide for migration, Klimley et al. (2017) reported that the large anomalies in steady 
magnetic fields produced by bridges were not found to present major barriers to the migration of these fish 
species in the San Francisco Estuary.

4 Conclusions 
Gradient performed an independent EMF assessment for the proposed underground 115-kV circuit to be 
constructed and operated as part of the Hingham Electrical Infrastructure Reliability Project (HEIRP).  The 
preferred Project route between the proposed Hobart II Substation in Hingham and the Eversource t ap 
station site at the Eversource ROW in Weymouth is a total of approximately 3.2 miles in length.  As 
discussed in this report, EMF modeling was conducted at a height of 1 meter (3.28 feet) above the ground 
surface for four  representative underground line cross section s, including (1) the t riangular conductor 
configuration for the typical underground duct bank trenches, (2) the horizontal conductor configuration 
for flat trenches, (3) the ver tical conductor configuration for manhole approaches, and (4) the HDD bore 
conductor configuration for the crossing of Herring Run Brook in Weymouth.  For each cross section, EMF 
modeling was conducted for both annual average and system peak load levels.  
 
Our MF modeling analysis show ed that all modeled post -Project MF values for each representative cross 
section at both annual average and system peak load levels, including directly above the circuit centerlines, 
are well below the ICNIRP health-based guideline of 2,000 mG for allowable public exposure to 60-Hz AC 
magnetic fields (ICNIRP, 2010 ).  This is the case despite a conservative modeling approach that did not 
consider the small reductions in magnetic fields from the induced GCC currents.  In all cases, aboveground 
MF values dropped off rapidly with increas ing lateral distance from the circuit centerlines ( e.g., 88-93% 
reductions at lateral distances of ±25 ft from circuit centerlines), such that aboveground MF levels decreased 
to negligible levels at short distances beyond the trenches.  In addition, MFs for the HDD bore installation 
case where the Project 115 -kV underground circuit will cross beneath Herring Run Brook in Weymouth 
are not expected to impact the annual migration of river herring to their upstream spawning grounds ; this 
conclusion is based on both the  lack of scientific evidence that river herring are magnetosensitive or rely 
on the earth's geomagnetic field to navigate to their spawning grounds , as well as the lack of scientific 
evidence that magnetic field fluctuations from 60-Hz AC transmission lines can serve as major barriers to 
migration to magnetosensitive marine species, such as salmon and eels.
