### Rule 4: Do Not Touch (Squawk-Maintained Fields)

These fields are read-only from Squawk. Never overwrite during migration:

| Field | Maintained By |
|-------|--------------|
| Repost By | Squawk (derived from publishing profiles + AI suggestions) |
| Doc Status | Squawk (INGESTED, etc.) |
| Critical (concern count) | Squawk (AI readiness assessment) |
| Posts (count) | Squawk (auto-counted) |
| Published (count) | Squawk (auto-counted) |
| Updated | Squawk (auto-timestamped) |
| Readiness Score | Squawk (AI assessment, except `needs_work` override for delayed posts) |
| Readiness Notes | Squawk (AI summary), BUT overwritten with `DELAYED:` prefix when post-index status is `draft/delayed` or `draft/updated` |

**Rendering exclusions:** The following fields are maintained by Squawk but **excluded from squawk-index.md** for readability. They remain queryable via `get_content_item` or `list_review_queue`:
- Doc Status (always `INGESTED` after migration)
- Critical concern count
- Posts count
- Published posts count
- Squawk CUID (document ID — available in the CUID mapping table in this doc)

### Rule 5: Drop Target Platforms

Target Platforms column is **no longer tracked**. Squawk handles distribution as part of its core publishing responsibilities. This column does not appear in squawk-index.md.

### Rule 6: Title Linkification

Use the document's `sourcePath` from Squawk to construct a local markdown link. The Title field in squawk-index.md should be a clickable link to the post's markdown file:
